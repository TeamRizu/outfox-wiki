NOTE: If you have an ASUS/Alienware/ACER Gaming/DELL Gaming/MSI Gaming/Medion Gaming/Sapphire Gaming/Sammsung Gaming/HP Gaming system and are running Windows 11 - it will try to throttle your machine to reduce your \u0026lsquo;carbon footprint\u0026rsquo; check your control centre, and your GPU/Controlpanel settings. My own Laptop was throttled to 30FPS on \u0026lsquo;office mode\u0026rsquo; but when switched to gaming mode, this was unlimited FPS!

Introducing support for OutFox\u0026rsquo;s 19th Game Mode - Boxing! This mode is designed to be set up at a gym and played with joy-cons or a similar setup. It\u0026rsquo;s great fun and has a variety of punch styles. We are working on gyro/VRK support so you can play this with those controllers.\n❕✅ NEW!! Introducing support for OutFox\u0026rsquo;s 20th Game Mode - rb! This mode compliments our gh mode and is based on the familiar chart format .mid The game supports. the mode is made up of rb-easy, which is the normal 4 drum lane without the kick, rb-normal, which is the usual 4 drum lane and supporting the kick, and rb-pro, which is 4 drums, 1 kick and 3 cymbals. You can utilise songs from gh which contain drum charts easily enough!\n.chart is going to be worked on later on, this is just the skeleton remember, so a theme and mode specification and changes will happen to improve the game module, as is done with all our supported games.\nThis mode also makes OutFox the only sim in the world to support 4 Different game drum modules: gddm, taiko, bongo, rb. We hope you\u0026rsquo;ll be as hype as us for this milestone, and to continue improving our coverage and accuracy in the modules that we support.\nrb supports PRO DRUMS out of the box, again the theme is lacking as we need to stop developing crap and focus on it in Q3/4 of this year. This mode also supports our MIDI drivers for eDrum kits! you can now use your eDrums on more than one drum mode!\n❕✅ NEW!! drum, pro-drum lane support for the mid parser!

There are still a couple of bugs which will be ironed out, but for 99% of users, this build will work fine.\nLOW LATENCY AUDIO GET!\nWith lower latency, comes some compromises. It is super clear and sharp, you have better clarity, it obviously uses new drivers, which include some new preferences, see below.\nWe have discovered Discord does NOT like low latency based drivers\u0026hellip; AT ALL. please bear this in mind if you decide to play with ASIO/set your CoreAudio below 1024, and ensure you have a secondary sound card Discord can use, so you aren\u0026rsquo;t greeted with silence.\nWINDOWS: ASIO supports down to a blocksize of 32 in the internal driver, now while you can set this in the new preferences (see below) if you hear crackling or garbled audio, just raise this a bit. You can use anything from 32 to 4096 as your block size, higher values being higher latency.\nWASAPI supports from 64 to 4096, and replaces waveout as the default driver. It has the benefit of not being legacy or using an old back end to output, and can have it\u0026rsquo;s buffer lowered to suit the system.\nLastly we have DirectSound, mainly due to the fact it has been requested for older windows builds, but users should always try to see if WASAPI (which is Vista -\u0026gt;) is available. DirectSound is 512 -\u0026gt;\nThe new driver has had to be sample rate locked and hardcoded to 44.1kHz right now due to limitations in the back end, but we will be removing all the old legacy code in the coming months, so you will be able to enjoy 48kHz clarity really soon.\nLINUX: ALSA now uses a new back end, as well as no longer using a 15 year out of date code pathway, we no longer have to patch it for OutFox. It fully supports shared mode, so no more silence on calls when you\u0026rsquo;re using it, and it also behaves better on the Raspberry Pi/SoC board for arm, fixing the 10+ year old bugs. If your kernel is pre 4.12, you may get a crash on the first run due to the old kernel code, but the game should find your system devices properly on the second run. We\u0026rsquo;re looking into this atm.\nPulseAudio now runs without the ALSA hook, and again isn\u0026rsquo;t exclusive or forces weirdness. It can run with low latency as well, as well as sharing properly. At this release, it will likely use the ALSA device, but we will be adding the option to choose the device the specific APIs can use, so watch this space for that. There is also a quirk with Pulse where it reports the output and input devices back to front, so we have put in a workaround for this too.\nJACK - Jack now is built in without the need for extra hooks or compiler options, and simply just\u0026hellip; works. If you do not use this driver, do not add it to your preferences, as this can cause a crash right now, it will be fixed in the final version of 041. JACK is also available on MacOS, a bonus feature there.\nBSD/CONSOLE: OSS 4+ is available for BSD builds\nMACOS: CoreAudio now runs newer code as well, which also fixes the odd quirk in Ventura with the audio thread sometimes dropping out. We will also add code for audio device handover, as this new driver supports it, so no more crashing when your bluetooth headphones die and disconnect. Be warned, however, Bluetooth audio can not take a too low block setting, so experiment.\nNew Preferences in this build SextetStreamInputFilename= Used for the new Sextet input handler I forgot to code in \u0026gt;.\u0026gt;\nSoundrtAudioAPIName= This selects the audio back end for your system. It will be self populated on first run with a safe default, but you can override it with a comma\u0026rsquo;ed list of inputs.\nYou have a choice of the following:\nMacOS core - Use for CoreAudio jack - Use for JACK\nLinux alsa - Use for ALSA jack - Use for Jack pulse - Use for PulseAudio oss - Use for the Linux OpenSoundSystem\nWindows asio - Use for ASIO wasapi - Use for WASAPI ds - Use for DirectSound\nThey can be used as a list with commas, so \u0026ldquo;wasapi,ds,asio\u0026rdquo;\nSoundrtAudioLastUsedCard= This is a pref to highlight the last used card, it\u0026rsquo;s purely for the internal driver, like \u0026rsquo;lastseenvideocard\u0026rsquo;\nSoundrtAudioNumberofChannels= This pref is for number of output channels/speakers your system supports. It will be up to 8 when the code is written, but for now, leave it at 2, due to the legacy code. It will be ignored if you add anything else!\nSoundrtAudioPreferredSampleRate= This pref is for the samplerate of your device, and will be settable in time. It will return the preferred rate your card wants, but will sadly be set to 44.1 due to the restrictions of the legacy code. Will be unlocked when we remove the rest of RageSound\nSoundrtAudioSetBufferSize= This pref is where you set your latency block size. It supports 32 frame to 4096 frames as per the ASIO/latency standards. If your audio crackles or glitches, remember to adjust this, it is not a bug in the game! With lower latency comes a bit more instability, so bear this in mind when you adjust this value.\nLinux users will need a lowlatency compiled kernel and preferrably a kernel newer than 4.12 to take advantage of this. MacOS users need Big Sur to use \u0026lt; 256, and Windows 7+ for \u0026lt; 128\nThis driver is not enabled on windows yet due to some quirks with windows 10/11 which we are looking into.\nOutFox 5.0.0 Pre-Release Candidate 041 -a3 - March 19th 2023 ❕✅ Fixed bug with some windows versions crashing on boot with a weird waveout quirk ❕✅ Fixed misaligned pomu noteskin layouts on bun/cat/retro skins ❕✅ NEW!

My own Laptop was throttled to 30FPS on \u0026lsquo;office mode\u0026rsquo; but when switched to gaming mode, this was unlimited FPS!

Introducing support for OutFox\u0026rsquo;s 20th Game Mode - rb! This mode compliments our gh mode and is based on the familiar chart format .mid The game supports. the mode is made up of rb-easy, which is the normal 4 drum lane without the kick, rb-normal, which is the usual 4 drum lane and supporting the kick, and rb-pro, which is 4 drums, 1 kick and 3 cymbals. You can utilise songs from gh which contain drum charts easily enough!\n.chart is going to be worked on later on, this is just the skeleton remember, so a theme and mode specification and changes will happen to improve the game module, as is done with all our supported games.\nThis mode also makes OutFox the only sim in the world to support 4 Different game drum modules: gddm, taiko, bongo, rb. We hope you\u0026rsquo;ll be as hype as us for this milestone, and to continue improving our coverage and accuracy in the modules that we support.\nrb supports PRO DRUMS out of the box, again the theme is lacking as we need to stop developing crap and focus on it in Q3/4 of this year. This mode also supports our MIDI drivers for eDrum kits! you can now use your eDrums on more than one drum mode!\n❕✅ NEW!! drum, pro-drum lane support for the mid parser! This required a major rewrite of the parsing system to match one similar to gddm/gdgf so the game knew which part of the chart was drum and such. Please test and let us know if there are any MIDI songs that have issues.

THIS BUILD HAS A NEW SOUND BACK END!! This build utilises a new back end and completely does away with the old SM5 drivers. It was super heavily requested by the community that we have something configurable that could be used to lower latency in the game for key-sounded and hit sounded modes, so we delayed this build to squeeze it in. There are still a couple of bugs which will be ironed out, but for 99% of users, this build will work fine.\nLOW LATENCY AUDIO GET!\nWith lower latency, comes some compromises. It is super clear and sharp, you have better clarity, it obviously uses new drivers, which include some new preferences, see below.\nWe have discovered Discord does NOT like low latency based drivers\u0026hellip; AT ALL. please bear this in mind if you decide to play with ASIO/set your CoreAudio below 1024, and ensure you have a secondary sound card Discord can use, so you aren\u0026rsquo;t greeted with silence.\nWINDOWS: ASIO supports down to a blocksize of 32 in the internal driver, now while you can set this in the new preferences (see below) if you hear crackling or garbled audio, just raise this a bit. You can use anything from 32 to 4096 as your block size, higher values being higher latency.\nWASAPI supports from 64 to 4096, and replaces waveout as the default driver. It has the benefit of not being legacy or using an old back end to output, and can have it\u0026rsquo;s buffer lowered to suit the system.\nLastly we have DirectSound, mainly due to the fact it has been requested for older windows builds, but users should always try to see if WASAPI (which is Vista -\u0026gt;) is available. DirectSound is 512 -\u0026gt;\nThe new driver has had to be sample rate locked and hardcoded to 44.1kHz right now due to limitations in the back end, but we will be removing all the old legacy code in the coming months, so you will be able to enjoy 48kHz clarity really soon.\nLINUX: ALSA now uses a new back end, as well as no longer using a 15 year out of date code pathway, we no longer have to patch it for OutFox. It fully supports shared mode, so no more silence on calls when you\u0026rsquo;re using it, and it also behaves better on the Raspberry Pi/SoC board for arm, fixing the 10+ year old bugs. If your kernel is pre 4.12, you may get a crash on the first run due to the old kernel code, but the game should find your system devices properly on the second run. We\u0026rsquo;re looking into this atm.\nPulseAudio now runs without the ALSA hook, and again isn\u0026rsquo;t exclusive or forces weirdness. It can run with low latency as well, as well as sharing properly. At this release, it will likely use the ALSA device, but we will be adding the option to choose the device the specific APIs can use, so watch this space for that. There is also a quirk with Pulse where it reports the output and input devices back to front, so we have put in a workaround for this too.\nJACK - Jack now is built in without the need for extra hooks or compiler options, and simply just\u0026hellip; works. If you do not use this driver, do not add it to your preferences, as this can cause a crash right now, it will be fixed in the final version of 041. JACK is also available on MacOS, a bonus feature there.\nBSD/CONSOLE: OSS 4+ is available for BSD builds\nMACOS: CoreAudio now runs newer code as well, which also fixes the odd quirk in Ventura with the audio thread sometimes dropping out. We will also add code for audio device handover, as this new driver supports it, so no more crashing when your bluetooth headphones die and disconnect. Be warned, however, Bluetooth audio can not take a too low block setting, so experiment.\nNew Preferences in this build SextetStreamInputFilename= Used for the new Sextet input handler I forgot to code in \u0026gt;.\u0026gt;\nSoundrtAudioAPIName= This selects the audio back end for your system. It will be self populated on first run with a safe default, but you can override it with a comma\u0026rsquo;ed list of inputs.\nYou have a choice of the following:\nMacOS core - Use for CoreAudio jack - Use for JACK\nLinux alsa - Use for ALSA jack - Use for Jack pulse - Use for PulseAudio oss - Use for the Linux OpenSoundSystem\nWindows asio - Use for ASIO wasapi - Use for WASAPI ds - Use for DirectSound\nThey can be used as a list with commas, so \u0026ldquo;wasapi,ds,asio\u0026rdquo;\nSoundrtAudioLastUsedCard= This is a pref to highlight the last used card, it\u0026rsquo;s purely for the internal driver, like \u0026rsquo;lastseenvideocard\u0026rsquo;\nSoundrtAudioNumberofChannels= This pref is for number of output channels/speakers your system supports. It will be up to 8 when the code is written, but for now, leave it at 2, due to the legacy code. It will be ignored if you add anything else!\nSoundrtAudioPreferredSampleRate= This pref is for the samplerate of your device, and will be settable in time. It will return the preferred rate your card wants, but will sadly be set to 44.1 due to the restrictions of the legacy code. Will be unlocked when we remove the rest of RageSound\nSoundrtAudioSetBufferSize= This pref is where you set your latency block size. It supports 32 frame to 4096 frames as per the ASIO/latency standards. If your audio crackles or glitches, remember to adjust this, it is not a bug in the game! With lower latency comes a bit more instability, so bear this in mind when you adjust this value.\nLinux users will need a lowlatency compiled kernel and preferrably a kernel newer than 4.12 to take advantage of this. MacOS users need Big Sur to use \u0026lt; 256, and Windows 7+ for \u0026lt; 128\nThis driver is not enabled on windows yet due to some quirks with windows 10/11 which we are looking into.\nOutFox 5.0.0 Pre-Release Candidate 041 -a3 - March 19th 2023 ❕✅ Fixed bug with some windows versions crashing on boot with a weird waveout quirk ❕✅ Fixed misaligned pomu noteskin layouts on bun/cat/retro skins ❕✅ NEW!

What Happened to 0.4.17? 0.4.17 passed initial testing from our valiant testing volunteers, however it failed the testing on cabinets and for those who use dance and pump modes for skill/technical based play. As the whole point of this LTS programme is to ensure stability and remove opportunity for the game to crash or have problems in general play this was unacceptable, and we went back to deep bug fixing which is why this release is later than planned, but provides a much more stable environment for play.\nAs with development we cannot guarantee you\u0026rsquo;ll never crash, but we have reduced bugs and situations where that could happen while you\u0026rsquo;re playing the game.\nWe hope you enjoy the fruits of our work, with this proper stable build, and appreciate your continued support!\nNew Mode: bongo! Based on a game for home consoles released in the early 2000s, this mode brings in a highly requested fan favourite to OutFox!\nPlayed using the left drum, right drum, and clapping, this fun mode at the moment uses the games TJA and OTO loaders to support fan created TJA content, and Mode 1 from osu files, though bear in mind, many of the osu files are not designed with fun in mind, so it may become painful using your hands to play these files!\nYou do NOT need to enable auto-gen for this mode! It uses any TJA or OSU files in your folders already to generate tracks! Remember our taiko support is ongoing, so some holds and effects do break sync, but we will be fixing these in time. We do not have a theme yet for this mode, so game-play is with the basic \u0026lsquo;default\u0026rsquo; for now, so you can have a play and feel for it!\nThis is our 18th Working Game Mode that this engine supports, and we are truly humbled by the awesome support you, the players, provide us to continue to improve and expand on what this museum contains within it\u0026rsquo;s wall of code!\nWe have designed this mode alongside the project OpenTaiko so that charts made using the new TJA letter types in the charting format will be cross-compatible between the two simulators moving forward.\nLong Term Stable Builds Are Here! (Take 2!) As part of our commitment to getting the game out of the eventual development hell, we have had a discussion and all agreed to keep the alpha 4.xx branch active for the next year while we work on finalising the alpha V branch.\nWhat this means to you, the end user, is that if you do not want to have to change builds all the time and deal with \u0026rsquo;new feature\u0026rsquo; bugs, then this branch will be maintained (for bug fixes only) in a 1 month bug fixing schedule until December 2022, then will move to a quarterly release schedule (so 4 more updates) until it is retired at the end of December 2023 with the final release being 4.24.\nThis branch is stable enough for the removal of the \u0026lsquo;alpha\u0026rsquo; prefix, and if you get any bugs or issues do report it. Things deemed important will be back-ported to the 0.4.x branch, but the team will be focussing more on 0.5.x in 2023 and beyond.\nNew PandaLog File System This month we also added a new logging system which will greatly help with any debugging needs that you have. We have changed the system, so that there is a main, a theme, and a crash-log now, and these have varying levels of detail, depending on need. If you happen to have a crash or need to debug a theme, or lua mod, this is now much easier to do.\nOn the log level preference, 0 shows full detail, where 5 will give you a reduced log-file, usually when you have everything set up and working well.\nPLEASE NOTE: As we no longer follow the SM logging system, we have added a dummy \u0026lsquo;info.txt\u0026rsquo; for the Windows launcher of GrooveStats so the launcher for that system still works. New FFMPEG system This release also sees some changes to the FFMPEG builds used in OutFox. We had discovered there is a memory leaking bug in upstream which doesn\u0026rsquo;t really affect many of the video players out there generally, the code we use to acquire and display video data is based on the functions that are bugged in newer versions, so folks using banners or video backgrounds would end up with crashing and freezes due to this.\nWe have reverted back to a much older \u0026lsquo;bug free\u0026rsquo; build of 4.x for the time being until it is fixed by upstream. If you get any quirks or errors on videos, do let us know; we tried a lot of different formats and videos commonly used, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t cover everything!\nLinux Joystick Pref This build adds a support option for those folks on some builds which have had evdev issues with the newer kernels (5.1+) making pads not show up.\nBy default OutFox uses the event system as this is recommended by distros like Ubuntu and Debian but with recent updates these can miss seeing pads and controllers.\nThe new pref UseLinuxJS (Use Linux JoyStick) sets /js* by default, so folks can access the controllers correctly. If you want the older behaviour, take a moment to set this to 0 in your preference.ini file in the /save folder. We will keep an eye on this for now, and if you get any errors about \u0026lsquo;access denied\u0026rsquo; ensure your user is in the \u0026lsquo;input\u0026rsquo; group using a terminal and:\nsudo usermod -a -G input USERNAME\nwhere USERNAME is your current user (type whoami) to see what this is in a terminal.\nLet us know if you have any issues, and pop into the Discord server if you need any help!\npump fixes! This month we have been working with the players and developers of the Infinitesimal theme for pump with fixing the hold situation in the simulation of this mode. With a lot of revisions and testing, we can happily report that the holds are operating properly now, and we are grateful to those that gave their time helping us perfect it!\nNew Always on Top Preference! This preference was requested by a lot of our streamer players, as they said it can cause issues with the streaming and capture methods they use.\nThis preference which is simply entitled AlwaysOnTop is set to 0 (false) by default, which is the normal behaviour of the game. To enable it while you stream you can set this to 1 and the game will always be on the top of the screen even if you click off or have a window behind it.\nThanks to Zui and Shrmp0 in the Discord for making the suggestion known to us and for our streamer friends for enjoying the game on different platforms.\nNew AllowRotation Preference! This preference was back-ported from Alpha V as some of our users have requested support for rotational options. This pref is off by default, and allows rotation for vertical based screens where the resolution/display is rotated, mainly for vertical options.\nStepLastSeconds Changes! For songs which have a multiple chart in the folder, like pump, be-mu, po-mu, kbx via osu etc, there is a slight bug in the way the game sends the \u0026rsquo;length\u0026rsquo; data to the theme/engine that counts stages at the moment. This is a long upstream bug and we are working on a fix in Alpha V, and will backport it when it is ready.\nThe issue is, if some charts are different lengths, they will show correctly in screen game-play, but only display the LONGEST length in the music wheel, or \u0026lsquo;ScreenSelectMusic\u0026rsquo; as it\u0026rsquo;s known to themers. Fixing this bug will also benefit other modes so it is something we want to work on.\nNew Installer for Windows! This release has an updated installer that better reflects the feel of OutFox, and gives us a better platform to use moving forward. We hope you like it!\nVersion 0.4.18 Fixes: KNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.18.0 ❕❌ ISSUE Playing be-mu/po-mu songs on Endless Mode may have a crash on song loading.

Please be aware it can be added to until the release is confirmed! Please read the change log! More be-mu (and po-mu) fixes This month we have been polishing the modes ready for their Alpha V debut with proper themes. We have stabilised the way keysounds are loaded, and in this release we have also fixed hidden \u0026rsquo;lanes\u0026rsquo; that the mode supported that were not played.\nThe parsing system has also seen another update, moving away from the legacy SM5 method and utilising the new OF style of properly defining and enabling all the lanes. In the past, StepMania could only mainly play a number of sounds related to the number of columns (lanes) and as the BMS reader was created for the historic DDR in BMS style charts, we had a lot of work to do to ensure proper expansion. In this release, the mode has seen some spring cleaning, enabling full keysound range, and properly displays and parses charts as it should.\npo-mu mode now also supports Player 1 11-19 channel modes, featured in nanasi and some other simulators from the early 2010s. This is sometimes known as \u0026rsquo;extended pomu\u0026rsquo;. be-mu now can also play back the correct keysounds, including the player hidden, and any effect channels that can be used.\nCharts which did not use all the lanes for their mode, (7k o2j inspired lanes without scratch are an example) would often also not show up correctly, or be shifted by an entire column, or just parsed incorrectly. This has been fixed in this release, so 5K / 7K / 10K / 14K (no scratch) charts now read correctly. Thanks to Daniel and our friends at the BMS international community for reporting this to us.\nIntroducing 64bit Windows Builds We have been testing the 64 bit windows builds for some time, but have yet to publicly release a build alongside our normal release programme, so this month changes that! The community have heavily requested the need for a 64bit build, especially with our multi-modal support system in place, which needs more songs/packs installed. Moving forward to our Steam integration, we needed to have a 64bit build for the users available on that platform.\nMoving forward, as a lot of you will have questions;\nNo, we will not be discontinuing Win32.\nYes, we will continue to provide Win32 builds as many of you with cabs will need them\nSteam will default to the 64bit build unless your system is 32bit.\nInternal library updates This month we have done several parity pulls from our upstream dependencies, as progress has been made on a lot of the bugs we had in the past. Vorbis and our other sound readers have enjoyed several bugfixes, as well as a big jump in bugs fixed in SDL has meant performance in this build has increased, especially for those on pre-2016 hardware, although everyone should see an improvement.\nWe have begun to add a few back-ports from the Alpha V Panda collection, designed to build stability as we look to sunset Alpha 4 next Spring. Alpha 4 Officially goes into LTS this month, being limited to only stability and bug fixes only. The main development push from August will be into Alpha V.\nWe will continue to support Alpha 4.xx until March 2023, but maintaining two separate branches would be too much to deal with for such a small volunteer team, and as a result, it\u0026rsquo;ll be retired properly when Alpha V has matured and stabilised enough to be considered a suitable replacement.\nKNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.14.0 ❕❌ ISSUE Playing be-mu/po-mu songs on Endless Mode may have a crash on song loading.

Good job. it means that the metric ShowBoard=true has been set. You can undo this to set it to false in modes that are not gh. It may show a message at the top of the screen if you have errors enabled, this will be here just as a temporary measure to see how often that metric was being set.\n❕✅ Fixed crash on playback when revert from disk was used in the editor ❕✅ Fixed bpm \u0026gt; 100000000 to be warps again ❕✅ Fixed minefields flashing on the receptor - Closes #558 ❕✅ Fixed quirk with autoplay not ignoring release ❕✅ Fixed check with type != group - Closes #557 pump mode updates. This month has has a plethora of updates and fixes added to the pump mode; we have been working a lot in the background for this mode, but it required a lot of other things to be implemented beforehand, so it has taken a bit longer than planned to get these stuff off the ground.\nThis release has fixed a lot of the music length issues, charts ending early, charts not ending at all, charts having missing notes due to the song finishing at the incorrect time, and charts ending after 2 seconds (single) / 7 seconds (double). The reason for a lot of all these quirks was due to the charting methods used in stepf2 and stepp1 being based off an older version of StepMania which then had some custom code added by xMAx for those versions targeting pump only. We would like to thank xMAx for the insight and assistance with implementing some of those features into Project OutFox, but due to the fact we are a multi-modal simulator we had to heavily rewrite and redesign a lot of the functions and systems behind the original ideas they had.\nWe have written a custom parser for the stepf2 charts which internally is called NotesLoaderPIU. This focuses on only parsing charts using the old editor and targets pump mode, including the custom note types, and the effects and systems the mode needs. The parser uses the SSC header #VERSION: 0.81 to initialise this pathway for those charts.\nThis can lead to a few issues if you have any dance charts using version 0.81, if you get any quirks, you can just change this version number to 0.83 and it\u0026rsquo;ll use the normal SSC parser.\nNew for this alpha, we have also added the feature for charts not set to 0.81, where you can create a blank file with the title ForcePIU in the group folder, and the game will use the PIU loader automatically. This is case sensitive, so use it as written here for it to work.\nThis alpha also begins to add support for notes within braces { 0 | h | 1 | v }. At the moment only h notes are implemented, with s and v planned for the next main alpha.\npumpholds have also had a major rewrite this release as well, with the stepping and judgement logic being more appropriate to the game system, with ticks and head logic being fixed as well. There are still likely to be a few quirks with it, as it\u0026rsquo;s new code, and do let us know if there are things you notice that are incorrect.\nWarps and how they are hit were also reworked, along with some notes and rows overflowing which caused a lot of the issues on how the game calcuated some of the file/song lengths in the musicwheel and evaluation screens. The values sometimes recorded in the #LASTSECONDHINT and #MUSICLENGTH in the cache file may not actually marry up - the game has several options internally for ensuring that songs do not go crazy on time. Again, this logic is new, so there may be edge cases that need to be ironed out. If you find a chart that is not behaving, let the team know so we can see what is happening.\nThere was also a lot of older code removed from the ScreenGamePlay branches of code that we inherited from older builds (3.x era) that we have removed as it was not really doing anything, and in some cases actually caused the new pump code to not function correctly. A few tweaks were also done for older .sm and .ksf charts and we fixed a lot of the math overflows due to the way the charts were implemented into the older SM build.\nYou can have a better experience than the \u0026lsquo;default theme\u0026rsquo; by downloading the new pump theme that is being developed called Infinitesimal from here; it will be incorporated into Project OutFox as a default theme for pump coming in Alpha V. The theme is created to give you a faithful experience, using original assets and textures.\nWe hope you guys have fun with the fixes, and we have more planned in time!\nbe-mu (and po-mu) fixes We had reports of the game being very unhappy with a lot of the earlier community charts from the BMS of Fighters series, and charts mainly created before 2009, so we have fixed a few of these not being parsed correctly.\nWe also have restored the 4k \u0026ldquo;DDR in BMS\u0026rdquo; chart support that Squirrel accidentally broke when adjusting the channel support. This has now been fixed and those simfile are recognised as dance charts once again.\nThere were also several crashes with the vs modes of po-mu and be-mu as well and these have been fixed as well, so 2 player works as intended.\nrtMIDI and portMIDI driver updates We have had a few requests to reimagine the midi drivers for those with DJ controllers or systems which use channels but send the same notes. The MIDI standard states a controller should be able to do this with the client application supporting the note/channel sent data, so we have changed the way this is done to ensure we are compliant. Crossfaders and rotary controls, as well as some pitch bend triggers do have some weird quirks at the moment, but as we don\u0026rsquo;t have any modes that support these at the moment do not try to map them as a control.\nWe added up/down jog wheel support for those who play be-mu on MIDI, so this works as designed now for everyone using midi for their jogs.\n(Incorporates Internal Builds 4.14.2-rc0 to 4.14.2-rc7) (Incorporates Internal Builds 4.15.0-rc0 to 4.15.0-rc15) The news sections will be completed shortly, the full changelog follows below: (Squirrel) KNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.14.0 ❕❌ ISSUE Playing be-mu/po-mu songs on Endless Mode may have a crash on song loading.

Following this release OutFox will be officially dropping the 5.3 prefix from our versioning to lessen confusion from our user base. We used to be 5.3.0.4.xx.xx as we were working on the game, but many of our users preferred to use the Alpha 4.xx versioning, leaving the 5.3 alone. Following consultation with ensuring we are compliant with our binary signing requirements, we have decided to drop this long version number and just use the 0.x.y.z which is a lot easier to read.\nInternally we were using the alpha builds like this to simplify our own understanding, and it seemed the easiest way to move forward. This build is formally known as 0.4.14, and we will be dropping versioning from folders and suchlike moving onward. We have removed the final parts that we needed for validation, so we are pleased to announce signed binaries for Windows will be available in the summer.\nThemes or systems which check for \u0026lsquo;StepMania\u0026rsquo; in the product family may fail to find OutFox until updated, we have reached out to the developers of Simply Love and let them know about our updates and they have let us know it will be updated in due course.\nIf you are using using Simply Love please follow the guide on the GitHub to replace the files in the mean time. Announcing a cross platform ParaPara Paradise Driver! Thanks to eks-d parapara for the image! (https://paramania.kirakira.org/ has an OutFox supported theme!) Following an overwhelming demand from the community, we have rewritten the old legacy PPP controller driver from the PS2 to work on all devices OutFox supports.\nTo use this new driver on your Mac or linux machine, go to your preferences.ini and use one of the following to get your controller to work:\nPlease Note: You will need to add one of these so your controller will work!\nWindows\n(para only): InputDrivers=para,legacy,minisdl (para and rtmidi): InputDrivers=para,rtmidi,legacy,minisdl Mac OS (M1 and Intel)\n(para only): InputDrivers=para,SDL (para and rtmidi): InputDrivers=para,rtmidi,SDL Linux (x86_64/ARM/Raspberry Pi)\n(para only): InputDrivers=para,SDL (para and rtmidi): InputDrivers=para,rtmidi,SDL The controller must be plugged in before you start OutFox, and it is recommended for M1 based Macs you have a USB C hub that has built in USB2 ports. This will give you the greatest compatibility with older hardware. Do send us your ParaPara setups, we\u0026rsquo;d love to see them!\nKNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.14.0 ❕❌ ISSUE Playing be-mu/po-mu songs on Endless Mode may have a crash on song loading.

This month we are proud to announce initial support for the stepstage mode. This mode is a simulation of the game Stepping Stage released in the arcade by the company Jaleco in 2000.\nThis game featured quite a unique layout, having 3 panels of input per column. The game used a dual column layout for the \u0026rsquo;normal\u0026rsquo; mode, which had 6 inputs total, with the left hand side of the pad being for left, and right side being right. There is a much easier \u0026lsquo;single\u0026rsquo; mode where all 6 pads are placed on a single column, but only the colour is needed to be hit, with the \u0026rsquo;left or right\u0026rsquo; side being ignored.\nThere was a home release of this game called Stepping Selection released for the PlayStation 2, and naturally, Project OutFox supports the use of this pad via the usual adapter, so you can play at home on the original dance mat.\nI took a photo of my dance mat as there weren\u0026rsquo;t many clear photos online - Squirrel The mode supports autoGen and can use dance/pump/kb6 charts to great success, and does support modfile cross-generation, so you can see the cool effects in this mode.\nWhat about other dance pads? If you have a dance pad with has the input buttons there are noteskins to help remind you of this so you can play this mode with the far right column, and far left:\nThis can allow you to play on any 9/8 panel mat made for other games with this mode, using Top Left / Left / Bottom Left and Top Right / Right / Bottom Right for the inputs.\nAnnouncing OutFox Serenity Volume 1 Winter Update! Welcome to OutFox Serenity, the official community song pack project for Project OutFox! Its purpose is to produce packs of \u0026ldquo;libre\u0026rdquo; songs for the game that can be freely redistributed (including as part of its default, bundled songs), and to showcase the extended mode support of Project OutFox by offering charts for multiple game types beyond just 4-key styles.\nInitially released on August 27, 2021, OutFox Serenity Volume I featured music by Aspid Cat, Drazil, Jack5, Matduke, mmry, PizeroFox, Seo, and Sevish. Alongside 4-panel dance and 5-panel pump charts, most of its songs also have be-mu, po-mu, techno (8- and 9-panel), gddm, gdgf, and gh charts.\nThe Winter Update to OutFox Serenity Volume I features three new songs by DJ Megas, Matduke and Pekoneko (ペコネコ). It also includes changes to some of the existing songs from Volume 1, including additional charts, and key-sounded be-mu/po-mu and gh charts for selected songs.\nFind out more here: https://github.com/TeamRizu/OutFox-Serenity/releases/latest\nTo download the game including the Serenity Pack, look for the download for your system which has Serenity in the Filename.

(Incorporates Internal Builds 4.12.0-rc0 to 4.12.0-rc7) (Incorporates Internal Builds 4.11.1-rc0 to 4.11.1-rc17) (Incorporates Internal Builds 5.0.0-editor-preview-r0 to 5.0.0-editor-preview-r31) New Folder Locations and Short News Update. This release will be moving the base application, folders and it\u0026rsquo;s naming to \u0026lsquo;OutFox\u0026rsquo;. This means it will not be using the \u0026lsquo;stepmania5.3\u0026rsquo; folder anymore, and it will install into an outfox folder. You will need to move your profiles over to this new version. The old version will also need to be uninstalled manually, sorry about all of this, it is just for this update.\nThere is no conspiracy behind the name change, we have to do this for application signing on the Mac and for the \u0026lsquo;MS Smart Screen\u0026rsquo; requirements for the certificates we need on Windows. This allows us to continue to be a free rhythm game that is now signed to ensure your confidence in the project, as well as ensuring the installers and packages are not tampered with. The Windows builds will be signed starting from next year, as it has taken time for the verification to complete. Our MacOS builds have been signed for a few alpha versions now, and with the \u0026lsquo;universal\u0026rsquo; binaries we are making the Mac experience better for our Apple Players.\nWith this release we are announcing that Project OutFox is becoming it\u0026rsquo;s own official fork. This gives an end to the confusion about our direction and this also allows those who wish to keep 5.1 installed having no risk of OutFox over-writing or damaging profiles or stored scores.\nI\u0026rsquo;d like to thank the StepMania community for making this decision a lot easier. The project is not the same as we started out in early 2019, and we are sorry we were unable to have a clearer \u0026lsquo;direction\u0026rsquo; than just \u0026lsquo;modernising the codebase\u0026rsquo; when we started. It is not our place to shoehorn this project into the StepMania repo, and a lot of you were very open about your feelings about that and as a result, Project OutFox will be on it\u0026rsquo;s own moving forward, and we will discuss with the StepMania community about what support we can bring in the future.\nThis month, we start off on our journey as a new standalone project, and thus a very exciting time ahead for our team. We have a new touch based theming system coming, new online, new leader-boards, (more new modes of course!) new platforms and modernisations to come over the next year. With the 2nd anniversary of the Public Alpha Programme, the team thanks you for the support and the good vibes you have brought us as we work on this project, and we hope you\u0026rsquo;ll stay with us for the rest of the journey!\nSigned Mac builds update! We have continued to work on our Mac builds since the last alpha, and this alpha will be released as a universal binary. This means we do not need to quarantine, nor worry about the systems we needed in the past to get the game to work. OutFox is fully signed and notorised, so this means installation is convenient and easy moving forward; you do not need to worry about which build to grab, as both will function as expected.\nNew Unicode/SHIFT-JIS support! This build also has very long overdue extended character support in the file handlers. BeMusic Script, and DTXMania files use different encodings to .SSC and .SM simfiles, and in the past, they often showed up as garbage characters, or mojibake characters which could not be easily read into the game. A simple fix for this was to convert the simfile into UTF8, but with many hundreds of files, this is not reasonable to ask of players!\n(DTXMania Files natively loading) This build correctly can detect the encoding with no user interaction, and will load them as expected into the correct game mode.\nThe new supported encoding types are:\nANSI/Windows Extended (SMA/BMS/DWI/KSF) SHIFT-JIS (BMS/BME/PMS/DTX/GDA/TJA) UTF-8 (DTX/BME/SSC/SM/OTO) UTF-8 BOM (GDA/DTX/TJA) UTF-8 Extended (TJA/BME/DTX) UTF-16 (DTX) UTF-16LE (DTX) UTF-16LE BOM (DTX) UCS-2 (DTX) This will mean songs using the new code paths for the encoding support will take a little bit longer to parse the first time, but having the support over not having it is worth it.\nThere will be opportunities to optimise the loading path, so it will get faster again!\n(BME files encoded in SHIFT-JIS natively loading) New and Updated Input Options! ALL OS: portmidi comes out of beta! prototype fsr midi controller This driver was written to accommodate the new DTXMania like mode, as the drum kits a lot of players use are MIDI based. This was the first time that our engine contained a fully functioning cross platform MIDI driver, the previous semi-broken win32-midi being Windows only. This new driver offers a 1ms clock timer and near realtime input on Linux and Mac OSX, but only supports one device connected to the system.\nWe are in the process of designing a MIDI based FSR controller for modes which need it as the MIDI system is currently the lowest latency for Windows based systems, and we hope to open source this in time, when the code is better (and Squirrel has the time!)\nThe reason we kept it in beta for so long was there was an identified need to have a MIDI driver capable of supporting more than one MIDI input device, as had been requested by be-mu and gddm players, like DTXMania has, being able to add a second device to enable menu control, or to enable non-standard setups, for example pedals or ride cymbals from a second kit.\nTo assist with this need, we added another MIDI driver to the game:\nrtmidi\nThis driver allows for more than one device support compared to our portmidi driver, which is limited to a single device, like an e-drum kit, or a DJ controller. rtmidi allows for more than one device to be connected for 2 player use, or for extra control for menu options for example.\nThe new rtmidi or portmidi driver can be added to your preference.ini if you wish to use it:\nPlease Note: You will need to add one of these so your controller will work!\nWindows\n(portmidi - you only have one device): InputDrivers=portmidi,legacy,minisdl (rtmidi - you have more than one device): InputDrivers=rtmidi,legacy,minisdl Mac OS (M1 and Intel)\n(portmidi - you only have one device): InputDrivers=portmidi,SDL (rtmidi - you have more than one device): InputDrivers=rtmidi,SDL Linux (x86_64/ARM/Raspberry Pi)\n(portmidi - you only have one device): InputDrivers=portmidi,SDL (rtmidi - you have more than one device): InputDrivers=rtmidi,SDL WINDOWS: legacy set to be the default and is out of beta! If you have been reading the previous changelogs, we have been testing a slightly modified version of the old SM4/5 input driver for those that prefer the \u0026lsquo;feel\u0026rsquo; of that era in input timing, and until the new GA driver is finished, (we are waiting for the Q1 2022 Win10/Win11 update) we will set this driver as default from this alpha.\nIf you are on an established preference.ini, to use it you can follow the style above:\nlegacy (Windows Only) InputDrivers=legacy,minisdl You can also leave this blank, or add MIDI if you plan to play DTX or use a MIDI based input device in the future. You will need the minisdl input driver for your window and operating system controllers, it allows for a smaller footprint on the game, and for your windows based playback this is important at the moment. It shows up in the \u0026rsquo;test input\u0026rsquo; screen as \u0026lsquo;Window Handler (aux)\u0026rsquo; so you have window controls, and full-screen etc support while keeping the base drivers compact. This driver will be default on all operating systems in due course, when the GA driver is complete.\nif you however need to have an Xinput supported device, or you have an advanced setup, you can reset the driver to how it was before this alpha with a simple change in your preference.ini:\nSDL Driver (Windows Only) InputDrivers=SDL This will enable the support for the Xinput system, and the legacy system in the default theme experimental options, (the UseOldJoystickMapping one) which will allow you to switch between the options.\nIf you use a ParaParaParadise controller you will need to add the Para Driver (windows only right now!) before your options in preferences.\nLegacy Driver (Windows Only) InputDrivers=Para,legacy,minisdl SDL Driver (Windows Only) InputDrivers=Para,SDL If you use a Reflex controller, you have several options, however it is best on Windows if you use the new legacy driver for now. To enable the Reflex controller , you need to add the following to your entry: (please note: You need legacy for keyboard input and to avoid HIDAPI problems!)\n(Only one player is supported at this time, however if there is demand we can add more player support! Bug Squirrel for more information!)\nReflex Driver (Windows Only) InputDrivers=Reflex,legacy,minisdl If you have a Python2/3 controller, like the above set up for the Reflex you can simply add your entry here, (remember to set up your COM ports etc as seen in the Windows Device Manager) and remember that this device is not seen in Windows 8 or higher due to the change in the way USB controllers became emulated.\nWindows Only InputDrivers=Python23IO,legacy,minisdl If you have a Rtio controller, you need to add this as the other controllers, remember that legacy gives you keyboard and mouse support.\nWindows Only InputDrivers=Rtio,legacy,minisdl Announcing smx mode! This month we are proud to announce initial support for the smx mode. This mode is a simulation of the game StepManiaX (https://stepmaniax.com/) by Step Revolution, and are long time friends of our project. You can join their discord here and give them some support!\nWe respectfully ask you to not try to rip or use official assets or songs as we want to keep the arcade scene alive and support the guys over at SMX! OutFox will not support the arcade timings or the smx sim file format, so please do not ask us for this! This mode was planned to be an Alpha V release, but with the pandemic, and the fact many of our players with SMX pads requested it. The pads are released when ready but you can Buy the pads here! and see when they are available again.\nThis mode will have some of the first non-arcade charted SMX files coming in the winter update of the OutFox Serenity Pack Volume 1.5 coming soon!\nSerenity smx charts The game mode is best played with the itg based timing, and the layout is familiar:\nIn game footage This mode has several cool new features with the beat bars, and with popular request we have added the colour differences to show the BPM/Stop changes on the notefield:\nPlease be aware that autoGen does work with this mode, and that we\u0026rsquo;ve been working on improving the memory use with the autogeneration until we have talented charters creating new content for it. Any other 5K sim-files that OutFox supports will work.\nWe say farewell to kb7 mode! The mode introduced with Team SSC has been retired in this alpha. There were many players who wanted it to be more than it was, and the use of the mode was generally for a small set of players, and the original creators of the mode also wished for it to be retired as well when we got the chance.\nWe salute the mode and what it did for StepMania at the time when it was released, but fear not kb fans and players, we are proud to announce:\nIntroducing kbx Mode! This is a revamp and rewrite of the KB7 mode, aimed at players that wanted a specific down-scrolling game mode, but with different sets of columns. We of course have varying modes with different sets and styles already, but there was no actual option to have things set in one specific place and one specific mode for it.\nThis mode supports 1 to 15 columns, and is a single player option. It will eventually get it\u0026rsquo;s own theme and other mechanics, but for now, it will fall back to our usual theme, but this does not make it any less playable!\nWe have decided to follow along the play style of ez2, or o2jam style of games, but giving our own little twist on things as is common with OutFox modes. In the future, there will be options to set this mode up to how you prefer, with styles and timing/scoring available to change up and adjust as always.\nThere is one specific thing about this mode however, The mod system is disabled. You may be wondering why we took the time to write a \u0026lsquo;slimmer\u0026rsquo; player options for this mode, well, in honesty there are a lot of things happening in the background we don\u0026rsquo;t use in some modes, and we wanted to try out turning some of these things off to see how it works with the game and performance styles.\nThe default noteskin for this game is based off of a synthwave style from the 80s, and we will continue to create the theme with this aesthetic.\nPLEASE NOTE: You do NOT need to turn on autoGen for this mode! The game will automatically create charts in the format and column size of supported sim files already on your system! The mode comes with a variety of noteskins and features out of the box, alongside a new interface and feature!\nThis skin reads the input assigned to each column and prints it within the space for you to remember where things are. This is helpful for you to learn the mode, and to discover play methods that you are comfortable with.\nThe default mapping for this mode is as follows: Please bear in mind, the button layout still needs work!\nkb1 = space kb2 = f j kb3 = f space j kb4 = d f j k kb5 = d f space j k kb6 = s d f j k l kb7 = s d f space j k l kb8 = a s d f j k l ; kb9 = a s d space f j k l ; kb10 = a w s d f j k l p ; kb11 = a w s d f space j k l p ; kb12 = a w s d r f j i k l p ; kb13 = a w s d r f space j i k l p ; kb14 = a w s e d r f j i k o l p ; kb15 = a w s e d r f space j i k o l p ; This set is just the auto-mapping, and as is always with OutFox everything is completely remappable, you can also assign controllers, MIDI input, drums, DJ controllers, pads etc to this and play in any way you like!\nThis is the o2jous noteskin which has the same feature that shows the keyboard mapping, but is less vibrant on the eyes.\nThe other news about this mode, is we have begun work on the OTO parser to enable osu \u0026amp; osz file support. We support the mania mode (3) at this time - (we were unable to finish the taitai (1) support in time, it will come soon!) The game reads them and can play them with synched video and bg changes, but we do not support osr or osb at this time.\nYou must place the files in the group folder as you would as normal with sim files from other modes. They will be created as a kbx chart type, they will NOT change over to dance or any other mode at this time! (unless you autoGen for them)\nThis mode supports multiple difficulty per folder, and will not make some versions \u0026lsquo;disappear\u0026rsquo; as the old versions did, and if there are multiple different songs in the same folder, the OTO parser can read and differentiate between the chart and it\u0026rsquo;s song/background, meaning you do not need to swap out anything or move stuff to individual folders. We will look into making this option available to other modes in the future. This new parser is based off of the .chart parser using line by line, splitting up each section into it\u0026rsquo;s own loading function.\nAs we were testing this mode, many of our awesome testing players suggested that we should have a \u0026lsquo;Lift-Hold\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;Normal Hold\u0026rsquo; modifier, to make the game more accessible and fun as sometimes the lift-hold requirement raised the difficulty of the chart too much, or players felt overly punished by the placement of the lift holds.\nThis alpha has a new modifier for this, it is available on the song options -\u0026gt; modifiers as seen in the screenshot below. Remember to access this you need to double tap when you have selected a song on the music wheel!\nThese options give a different play style to the pink game, and makes it a lot more accessible to folks playing.\nWe hope you have fun with it, and do let us know what you think!\nKNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.12.0 ❕❌ ISSUE Playing be-mu/po-mu songs on Endless Mode may have a crash on song loading.

This release will be moving the base application, folders and it\u0026rsquo;s naming to \u0026lsquo;OutFox\u0026rsquo;. This means it will not be using the \u0026lsquo;stepmania5.3\u0026rsquo; folder anymore, and it will install into an outfox folder. You will need to move your profiles over to this new version. The old version will also need to be uninstalled manually, sorry about all of this, it is just for this update.\nThere is no conspiracy behind the name change, we have to do this for application signing on the Mac and for the \u0026lsquo;MS Smart Screen\u0026rsquo; requirements for the certificates we need on Windows. This allows us to continue to be a free rhythm game that is now signed to ensure your confidence in the project, as well as ensuring the installers and packages are not tampered with. The Windows builds will be signed starting from next year, as it has taken time for the verification to complete. Our MacOS builds have been signed for a few alpha versions now, and with the \u0026lsquo;universal\u0026rsquo; binaries we are making the Mac experience better for our Apple Players.\nWith this release we are announcing that Project OutFox is becoming it\u0026rsquo;s own official fork. This gives an end to the confusion about our direction and this also allows those who wish to keep 5.1 installed having no risk of OutFox over-writing or damaging profiles or stored scores.\nI\u0026rsquo;d like to thank the StepMania community for making this decision a lot easier. The project is not the same as we started out in early 2019, and we are sorry we were unable to have a clearer \u0026lsquo;direction\u0026rsquo; than just \u0026lsquo;modernising the codebase\u0026rsquo; when we started. It is not our place to shoehorn this project into the StepMania repo, and a lot of you were very open about your feelings about that and as a result, Project OutFox will be on it\u0026rsquo;s own moving forward, and we will discuss with the StepMania community about what support we can bring in the future.\nWith this release, we start off on our journey as a new standalone project, and thus a very exciting time ahead for our team. We have a new touch based theming system coming, new online, new leaderboards, (more new modes of course!) new platforms and modernisations to come over the next year. With the 2nd anniversary of the Public Alpha Programme, the team thanks you for the support and the good vibes you have brought us as we work on this project, and we hope you\u0026rsquo;ll stay with us for the rest of the journey!\nSigned Mac builds update! We have continued to worked on our Mac builds since the last alpha, and this alpha will be released as a universal binary. This means we do not need to quarantine, nor worry about the systems we needed in the past to get the game to work. OutFox is fully signed and notorised, so this means installation is convenient and easy moving forward; you do not need to worry about which build to grab, as both will function as expected.

We have continued to worked on our Mac builds since the last alpha, and this alpha will be released as a universal binary.

OutFox is fully signed and notorised, so this means installation is convenient and easy moving forward; you do not need to worry about which build to grab, as both will function as expected.\nBMS updates! Difficulty Changes:\nWe have adjusted the way the game reads these files, and as a lot of the charts are seen as the same difficulty we would end up losing a lot of the information in them, and half of the charts would be missing and unplayable. We are in the process of improving this further for the new theming, so it will be better in time.\nThis month continues our work on BMS support, and we can happily announce we have proper Land Mine channel support in the game for the first time! In previous versions there was a blanket math overflow which meant that a lot of the channels were not being identified correctly, and thus flagging for extended channels were not being used.\nThis month also sees some fixes with the Long Note support offered by the game, we did not seem to parse these correctly due to the flag sometimes being applied in the wrong manner, which meant some of the holds were not being applied in charts.\nWe have also restored #RANDOM support again this alpha, as it was still using a legacy codepath we did not clear up in 4.9.10, apologies for that! This alpha allows for the #RANDOM n where n is 1 onwards.\nThis alpha also included several behavioural changes in the way the files are parsed, allowing for the correct Base to be used in reading channels and allowing us to enable the missing hidden sounds as well as the missing channels that were inaccessible before.\nLand Mine damage based on the channel value will be added next alpha, so we can add this final part to the game.\npo-mu updates! Like with BMS, the fixes with the difficulty are passed along to all of the BMS-like parsers, so we are now able to view all of the difficulties a file may contain.\nWe have been able to adjust the channels used for po-mu to support Land Mines for the first time as well, and this also includes BME based po-mu files are properly supported as well in this alpha, though without locale emulation, they will not load in native Windows 10 at this time. A fix for this is coming soon.\ngddm updates! This mode has had some internal reworking due to recommendations from some of the DTXMania community (thanks APPROVED!) to ensure that we do a few things a little bit more to how players expect. One of the important features was the ability to change the lane setting from 10 to 9 lane, or 9 to 10 lane, depending on the e-drum kit you have.\nWe were already able to read and support multiple lanes in older alpha builds depending on the \u0026lsquo;dominant\u0026rsquo; right hand lane, but now if the game does not spot it as the style you wish you can change this in the options menu.\nReal mode is 10 lane, and New mode is 9 lane. This gives you the flexibility to play the game how you wish moving forwards with the new theme and makes things less awkward if you do not have a 10 piece e-drum kit.\nThis alpha has also worked a bit more on the latency issues plaguing some users, we have tweaked the keysound flow a lot this build, so please give it a try and let us know if this has improved gameplay for this mode.\nThis build also has had work on the \u0026lsquo;Channel 02/BL\u0026rsquo; support to remove the old BMS era restriction. This means any measure change/time signature change is now respected, and thanks to APPROVED to making this chart which was a literal BPM Change / Time Signature Change Spam Chart we were able to effectively fix this for good. This change is also reflected in the gdgf mode as well as the GDA parser.\ngdgf updates! Before this alpha, all the game was able to use on this mode was Autogen based charts. Thanks to Squirrel and Jousway, the parser has been finally fixed and implemented to allow 3 fret and 5 fret guitar and bass charts to finally load natively in engine.\nThank you all for your patience while we worked on this, it was a slog to try to transpose the system to something our game recognises!\nGDGF is based on a row system, and our internal mechanism is column based, and has been for some time, so ensuring this methodology is carried over was important. We still have a lot to do before simulation is better here, so please bear with us. We do NOT support the holds yet that were introduced in DTXMania AL, these will be done at a later date.\nThis mode also has had the 6 fret custom mode that we promised back in the spring, as we know a lot of folks wanted 6 fret availability in OutFox. We have chosen cyan as the sixth fret to follow the colour scheme of Yellow Pink Cyan from the original.\nThis mode also supports full up, down, and forward WAIL controls, as requested by members of the community. To map this you will need to ensure your controller has the options to allow for wailing, as many newer guitar controllers have special \u0026lsquo;button\u0026rsquo; modes for wailing. We will add new controller pages to the wiki to help players set up their games in due course.\nWe have also begun a project to release a new proposal for a BMS-like BGF based parser for this mode which will include all 6 frets. Squirrel will be adding the information for this on the wiki for discussion and feedback is more than welcome! Remember! The game styles have changed for GDGF in this alpha. We will update the OutFox Serenity pack to reflect this during October\ngh updates! We have continued to work on the internal mechanics on this mode, so do forgive us while we fix things! This alpha sees new backplate (highway) support, (thanks Jous!) and new noteskin support within the engine. the measure lines and textures now behave as expected and thanks to those of you that requested these features.\nThe internal notefield and scrolling system has seen some updates as well as we move towards Alpha V.\ndance updates! This mode also saw some updates this month; the RNG system was given a revamp, the stageseed generation was also fixed, as well as better audio parsing. Thanks for all the reports of the odd edge cases with some of the odd \u0026lsquo;stuttering\u0026rsquo; bits and pieces you sent in! this was due to an undesirable response in the sampler expecting a calculation from the \u0026lsquo;old\u0026rsquo; resampler path that didn\u0026rsquo;t exist on the new resampler so we tweaked it to stop this.\nThere has been other engine adjustments, we discovered a few other weird bugs in how the buffer works due to the new Keysound code for BMS and po-mu and this has resolved a bug for dance modes.\ntechno updates! We fixed the methodology of the lifebars and the odd crashes with the styles and different play styles available to this mode. There were a lot of edge case crashes which we have fixed for now. In regards to styles, we WILL be fixing the ability to play different styles per player. It\u0026rsquo;s disabled for now to just prevent arcade cab crashes.\nKNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.10.0 ❕❌ ISSUE Playing beat/popnsongs on Endless Mode may have a crash on song loading.

I\u0026rsquo;m giving you a little update from OutFox HQ as I am sure you are curious on what went on with the 4.9.9 release and its many tweaks and Hotfix builds.\nSo let me describe what happened and why we did what we did.\nTo prepare for the new parsing and profile system that is upcoming for Alpha V, it is time that the engine is modernised to support more than just \u0026ldquo;American English\u0026rdquo; and the ANSI/ASCII standard. For those who don\u0026rsquo;t like the abbreviations, it means text in English. OutFox, and historically StepMania was never really written with foreign language support or any type of loading or conversion support for files or text in different languages other than American English.\nAs you know we are expanding the game modes the engine supports and as a result of this, it adds new improvements to the \u0026ldquo;bread and butter modes\u0026rdquo; (dance, pump) so it benefits everyone in the long run. Last month we upgraded the internal parsing system to proper understand Japanese and Korean loading as well as SHIFT-JIS internal text for our pop\u0026rsquo;n/po-mu, BMS, DTX and the DDR charts which used them. This was a really successful update, and fixed around 18 bugs in SM5, and allowed a lot more charts to be successfully loaded into the game.\nBuilding on this success, we then decided to fix the long standing issue of \u0026ldquo;one simfile to rule them all\u0026rdquo; which was: if there were more than one simfile, it only loaded one of those simfiles, usually spotting the SSC then forgetting everything else. As we will be supporting a wide range of new notes loaders in the future, we wanted to remove this bug to expand on specifically BMS/PMS and the Dance charts. This worked once again with great success.\nHowever, it was all about to come undone as our players with cabinets found out.\nFixing these bugs to our horror we were hit with a lot of reports of missing scores, no history found, groovestats and the SRPG groups, as well as everybody.dance and other things built on SM5 literally crashed and burned, due to the reliance on those bugs being included in the code.\nWe rushed to adjust how we did the loading, and we had to for the moment readd the bugs back for groovestats as this was completely broken for folks who wished to share their scores.\nIt also broke saved scores, and hashed lists because we fixed the loading paths, but folks had years of scores on a bugged loader. To top it off, we allowed the evil that was DWI to load, so folks ended up with duplicate listings and all sorts of craziness we did not expect. My own cabinet fell foul of the DWI problem: I had converted them years ago, but never deleted the files. So now we loaded more than one loader, this was a problem!\nI will say thanks to DomITG and Zankoku from the stamina community for taking the time to work through fixing these bugs as we were lost a bit on how the hashing and loading system affected groovestats and the other score sharing systems.\nThe reason we had such a flurry of hotfixes is due to we would solve one bug to have another reported almost an hour or two after we released, so it was a cat and mouse chase to get them fixed as they were affecting cabinets and folks\u0026rsquo; scores. These bugs only affected dance and ITG due to the fact all of these APIs had been built on them. I am not making excuses here, we should have been more thorough.\nWe had discovered that 21 issues arise within the folder/file parsing system, and that most things depend on this being the way it has been for around 15 years. We have enabled multi loading for other modes and file types, but have returned the SSC -\u0026gt; SM -\u0026gt; DWI rule that was common to the bugs in 5.1.\nWe humbly apologise for this, as we were not expecting that level of damage to established systems in the community. We had to re-enable the bugged code for now until we can look at a new way to fix scores and hashes so that the score shares and players histories are not affected by the new loading system.\nFor the tl;dr - we updated something in our parsers and file loaders, that broke all the scores and share systems due to them being built on bugged code. We had to release loads of fixes as folks reported the bugs.\nI hope that clears things up a bit, and that you don\u0026rsquo;t hate us too much for the errors, we did revert the code to ensure backwards compatibility was maintained. It sometimes happens in alpha development, we do sometimes update things with the best intentions, which breaks a \u0026ldquo;StepMania thing\u0026rdquo; horribly. The codebase is still a massive adventure for us too.\nThis update brings together all the hotfixes and finally puts a lot of the little niggles to rest.\nALL: ❕✅ Fixed Pitch being offsync a bit ❕✅ Fixed crash with missing GDDM Strings ❕✅ Fixed hang crash with leaving screens ❕✅ Fixed resampler ❕✅ NEW Column Judgements for modes that need it: gddm/popn ❕✅ NEW PomuPlus judgements ❕✅ Fixed crash in DTX with some files not using the full 9 lane width ❕✅ NEW Add KeySound loading Screen ❕✅ Fixed Crash with SM/SSC loaders ❕✅ Fixed Crash with OpenGL \u0026lt; 2.1 initialisation ❕✅ Added new loading screen animation for BMS/PMS etc ❕✅ Fixed resampling of \u0026lt; 32kHz sound files ❕✅ Fixed downsampling of 48kHz sound files ❕✅ Fixed block on ragesound causing edge case crash ❕✅ Allowed loading window to be software if system has no DRI on linux ❕✅ Fixed AFT overflow in texture generation, caused issues on Mac M1/RPi ❕✅ Fixed attacks disappearing on Linux and MacOS ❕✅ Fixed orient math ❕✅ Fixed non column judgement modes having lua errors on mods/autogen ports ❕✅ Fixed visibility with PIU noteskins ❕✅ Removed SM4 era remaining sprites. ❕✅ Optimised BMS and PMS parsing ❕✅ Added #SUBARTIST and #CREDIT support to BMS/PMS ❕✅ Fixed time-spacing calculation of graphs in gameplay ❕✅ Added new drumDTX noteskin ❕✅ Changed sound on taiko keysound ❕✅ Fixed holds on paw noteskin pixel offset ❕✅ NEW GDA parser for BandJAM/GDAMania era 6 lane drum charts ❕✅ Fixed bug in RTIO not noticing player 2 ❕✅ Fixed quirky edge case bugs in DTX and PMS ❕✅ Fixed AV crash in course loader on windows 7-\u0026gt; and MacOS 10.12/10.13 ❕✅ Fixed timing data in BMS derived parsers ❕✅ NEW Keysound notedata layer, reduces lag ❕✅ Fixed measure count update ❕✅ Fixed XInput crash on windows 8/8.1 ❕✅ Fixed keysound calling ❕✅ Fixed crash on syncmachine ❕✅ Fixed crash on autogen when using 32 bit windows 8.x ❕✅ Fixed autokeysounds quirk ❕✅ Fixed error checking in loading window ❕✅ Fixed elements not resetting in SelectMusic Panels ❕✅ Removed all cmd() references from BGAnimations and Background Effects ❕✅ Restored old .SM 3.x/4.x named styles (bm-* / iidx-* /etc) so they use the modern equivalent (ask if any show up with the \u0026lsquo;unknown style/stepstype\u0026rsquo; in the log) ❕✅ Fix Unjoin player being in the wrong place ❕✅ Add maniax default notes ❕✅ CloseFolder message added to CodeDetector ❕✅ Fix Entries for Techno Mode ❕✅ Fix pump noteskin aesthetics ❕✅ Fix steps played in graph display / combo display ❕✅ Add pump luatimings ❕✅ Fix glider note down ❕✅ Add pump judgements ❕✅ Fixed overflow in BM98 channel calls Hotfix tweak updates ❕ Fixed missing score issue by restoring bugged SM5.1 code ❕✅ Fixed stats.xml glitch due to bad parse - Thanks Zankoku for the assistance on this! ❕✅ Fixed ScreenMessage Overflow on some systems ❕✅ New libsamplerate resampler - faster pipeline ❕✅ Fixed pointless crash on ScreenMessage ❕✅ Fixed crash/hang when using GrooveStats ❕✅ Fixed hang on Simply Love when using Solo ❕✅ Increased RageLog buffering to prevent overflow crashes with lots of files/Key Sounds ❕✅ Reduced Log output on DTX ❕✅ Fixed visual request on GLX/X11 ❕✅ Removed Windows 98 calls ❕✅ Fixed some obscure 2001 DWI files crash ❕✅ Fixed DWI title destroying hash keys ❕✅ Fixed DWI loading\u0026hellip; nothing at all\u0026hellip; ❕✅ Fixed PMS table corruption ❕✅ Fixed BMS hash table creation ❕✅ Fixed SSC/SM hash generation ❕✅ Fixed Sound buffer width sometimes getting to the max ❕✅ Fixed freeze on Jukebox with some non-dance modes ❕✅ Fixed sound scheduler on Windows/Linux ❕✅ NEW Sound tweaks for haste and rate, based off of new code ❕✅ NEW Sound resample preference, leave it alone for now, as it replicates RageSoundResample fine. ❕✅ Fixed SM hash corruption ❕✅ Fixed DWI being loaded due to lazy people not cleaning their simfile folders ❕✅ The system will not load DWI if an ssc or sm is found ❕✅ Fixed odd SM title bug ❕✅ Fixed Crash with older hardware not supporting what it advertises ❕✅ Fixed Crash with course loading that affected some folks with \u0026gt;640 songs ❕✅ Fixed Notesloader issues with Mac and Linux ❕✅ Fixed GCC / Mac compile ❕✅ Fixed Windows 10/11 affinity issues ❕✅ Fixed Occasional spike on Windows 10/11 when using an XInput controller ❕✅ Taiko adjustments for notefield ❕✅ Fixed SM/SSC loading to be more cabinet friendly.

Do remember to just drag and drop as the dmg lets you know how to do so, and it will run as other applications. Thanks to Jose and Squirrel for their efforts, and Jose for puzzling through, and Jousway for fixing one of the bugs in gh mode which was causing issues as well.\nNotes Loading There were several issues with the notes loaders and how antivirus/software protection apps were seeing OutFox when we were loading simfiles. This alpha hotfix now has addressed this by allowing you all to add more than one simfile in a song folder, cutting down on the folder rabbit hole. As we move to a more multi-game engine, this will also allow you to keep things tidy on your drive, and ensure it is a seamless experience for you all. Of course, please check the audio files are the same for the chart you are going to add to the folder, as you may find you have a nasty sync issue, but we also now support multidifficulty setups, as this is required for pump and taiko specifically.\nDifficulty System Revamp This hotfix also sees a tweak to the difficulty system used in OutFox. In the past it was tied to the DDR paradigm and then left to rot as one of those \u0026lsquo;StepMania Things\u0026rsquo;. This however really stifled what we could do within the engine, especially with modes with different names/brackets etc. With the release of gddm and taiko we needed more difficulties than the game offered, so this has now been resolved. Themes which are based off of 5.1/5.0.x will still work due to the numbers being the same as before. If there are any issues with your theme, do let us know, but we have tested several with no issues.\nNew #VOLUME and #PAN These features have been missing from our keysound support since 2002, and we are proud to say that we have them in this hotfix! They are completely supported in gddm from the parser, (do reset your cache of course!) and they also work in beat/popn. taiko will need the support as well, so shout out to Jous for putting up with my waaaahh-luigi on getting it added to the game. This build also supports the hidden chips/keysounds for gddm and we\u0026rsquo;ll work on getting the final compatibility added in due course.\nNew gh Modernisation Due to the need to run with a slightly more secure runtime on Mac OS Catalina/Big Sur/Monterey on the Intel based macs there were some functions in our gh mode which gatekeeper did not approve of. The way the notes were cast have been fixed, fever/star power has been sorted to be more gh3 like, and taps and open strums are also tweaked to be better. Please give them a try and let us know!

We apologise for the issues this update caused. Ensure you have downloaded 4.9.9HF3b Right, we finally fixed the annoying RageFile glitch that was affecting the hash system to be different to 5.1/5.0.12. Sorry about all this hassle, we fixed a wedge of bugs in the loading system, but did not expect everyone to have built massive amounts of stuff on top of these bugs being there, so we have adjusted the system so backward compatible themes / API / ScoreShare / Groovestats etc once more work again.\nThanks for being so patient while we ironed this out! it has been a pain!\nWhy the hotfix rush?! For those curious about the flurry of hotfix patches, we fixed the way the game sees a lot of non-ASCII based file names and folder names. This allowed for us to support accented characters as well as glyphs and japanese characters, alongside with what we found before. This allowed for us to finally fix the bug of \u0026lsquo;one file per folder\u0026rsquo; which was done for DWI way back in 2002, so as we move to a more mode agnostic (we support more than one game mode) we can allow users to have simfiles for different modes/games in the same folder. This was perfect on OutFox specific things - but broke most stuff on 5.1/5.0.12 horribly.\nWhat we had not realised was that a lot of things had been built up on this old bugged behaviour over the years, and that for some reason, there was a hash of the path of the simfile which was being picked up by all these systems. This completely changed the reported hash, and thus score reporting things or sharing things suddenly didn\u0026rsquo;t know their hash and it also didn\u0026rsquo;t help with DWI being so jank it broke even how SM saw some of the charts.\nWe have kept the multiloading system in place. We need this for other modes, however we have adjusted carefully the loading system for SM/SSC/DWI so it matches back to how past versions work, so all of these things can remain intact and working.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll need to think hard on how to apply the fixes in the future, as we don\u0026rsquo;t really want all of this all over again!\nALL: ❕ Fixed missing score issue by restoring bugged SM5.1 code ❕✅ Fixed stats.xml glitch due to bad parse - Thanks Zankoku for the assistance on this! ❕✅ Fixed ScreenMessage Overflow on some systems ❕✅ New libsamplerate resampler - faster pipeline ❕✅ Fixed pointless crash on ScreenMessage ❕✅ Fixed crash/hang when using GrooveStats ❕✅ Fixed hang on Simply Love when using Solo ❕✅ Increased RageLog buffering to prevent overflow crashes with lots of files/Key Sounds ❕✅ Reduced Log output on DTX ❕✅ Fixed visual request on GLX/X11 ❕✅ Removed Windows 98 calls ❕✅ Fixed some obscure 2001 DWI files crash ❕✅ Fixed DWI title destroying hash keys ❕✅ Fixed DWI loading\u0026hellip; nothing at all\u0026hellip; ❕✅ Fixed PMS table corruption ❕✅ Fixed BMS hash table creation ❕✅ Fixed SSC/SM hash generation ❕✅ Fixed Sound buffer width sometimes getting to the max ❕✅ Fixed freeze on Jukebox with some non-dance modes ❕✅ Fixed sound scheduler on Windows/Linux ❕✅ NEW Sound tweaks for haste and rate, based off of new code ❕✅ NEW Sound resample preference, leave it alone for now, as it replicates RageSoundResample fine.

TEXTURE FONT GENERATOR V0.34 ❕✅🐲📝 Added ? \u0026amp; ! to number glyph profile ❕✅🐲📝 Fixed MFC overflow preventing compile ❕✅🐲📝 Fixed PNG causing a crash on legacy codepages ❕✅🐲📝 Fixed compile on visual studio community 2019 This build requires a cache reset if you are on Linux or MacOS, due to the internal changes. Please find your save folder and delete the contents of /cache. This will make your first time run of 4.9.9 slightly longer as it has to rebuild the index, but it is to accommodate the new modes/setup etc. Please remember to restart the game after doing a cache build, so you do not have as many issues with memory management. New (and some Old!) Modes Update Version 2 Following on from the last release, we have continued to improve and revamp the note system for the new modes, with Jousway taking the time to make available new types and styles available that were never before. This month fixes some omissions we made from the last release, which slipped through the testing teams.\npump We have fixed the scoring bug that was in the previous build, and thank you for those who took the time to report the issues. Keep in mind that Soundwaves still uses \u0026lsquo;dance\u0026rsquo; paradigms for scoring, but other themes that use different scoring systems based on \u0026lsquo;pump/piu\u0026rsquo; should work correctly now.\nThe tick-count has been tweaked to work correctly as there was a miscalculation in the offset math inherited from upstream. This now behaves as expected.\nGetting random misses on hold heads has been resolved as well as the holds with small tails (mini/micro holds).\nSupport for co-op charts has been added. 5 player is introduced with up to 10 players support, though the noteskins have not been prepared at this time. The numbers on the noteskins are separately labeled so with a few adjustments and extra assets you will be able to update any noteskin to work with co-op. Co-op charts made on StepF2/StepP1 should work on OutFox, however, better note types are currently being developed by Jousway so that there can be more than 3 real players defined. Stay tuned!\nThose of you who have reported that we still have a \u0026lsquo;superb\u0026rsquo; bug on holds, this will be fixed when we introduce the new piu mode - remember the pump mode is getting Quality of Life updates for now, before we move over to updating things properly in the future.\nMicro/Miniholds also do not trigger misses/cause a weird tick to happen anymore, and there also are no \u0026lsquo;phantom\u0026rsquo; mines in long (5+ measure) holds - this was an oddity which has been fixed now.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re still working on improving SF2/SP1 custom charts parsing. Except for a few charts, you can play the majority of content made for it on OutFox with no problems. As always, if you find any oddities make sure you report them to us!\npopn There was also a reported issue where some of the channels (lanes) of the PMS 7 button mode were not parsing correctly, or were actually being missed completely, resulting in a chart \u0026lsquo;misplacing\u0026rsquo; green and blue lanes. This was due to Squirrel misreading the spec on how BMS98/PMS was transcribed and set up the function wrong. It is fixed in this release.\nWe also have added 18 lane mode (No PMS/(BME) File support yet though!)\nThank you to all of those that took the time to report this and to kick us into getting outfox into a proper BMS/PMS parser. There are still a few features missing from po-mu mode, but these will be added to the game as per the spec (see the table below for more information.)\npopn mode also had a few tweaks and adjustments this alpha mainly in how keysounds are loaded within the game. This should now mean the mode should be smoother overall.\nThanks to the channels being set right, we also are happy to announce another feature to \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; mode: 2 player! This was not available on the original client, but it did always irk us how there was never 2 player options other than 3 button battle. In a future update, there will be a battle mode for \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; but for now, enjoy the 2 player fun. We will finally be having a theme for \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; in OutFox really soon, so this is finally a move from the \u0026lsquo;dance\u0026rsquo; centric era of the application\u0026rsquo;s past.\nHave some fun with mod files from dance on popn-four\nbeat will be getting some attention this next quarter! para We have given this mode a polish (and for those with an arcade cab, with 3 sensors doing nothing!) we added the \u0026lsquo;fabled\u0026rsquo; 360, or 8 sensor mode. This mode was designed for in the arcade for when the player twirls or turns, but was never actioned. The sensors for the back are actually there! This mode adds that, and for those who feel adventurous, we will be publishing some information on how to make your own 360 8 sensor panel controller in due course.\ntaitai Announcing our 15th mode!\nTaiTai is based off of a popular game where you hit a drum in it\u0026rsquo;s face. The game is horizontally based, with the notes travelling from right to left, and you hit the drum when the note gets to the receptor. The orange notes are for the inner part of the drum, and the blue ones are for the outer rim of the drum.\nFor the moment, some of the quirkier parts of this mode are a work in progress, bear with us as we also write new parsers for this mode. We plan to add support for the special note types and other effects in the game, as well as improve timing and other bits and pieces that are still yet to do.\nOnce more, we have no theme for this yet! (We are an alpha after all!) However, we will have a theme available for this soon that will give the mode polish and a playable feel.\nWe still have the scoring and timing system to finish, along with effects on double notes/taps and the \u0026lsquo;roll\u0026rsquo; notes which you hit as much as you can. Feel free to give it a run and let us know what you think!\nThere is a collection of noteskins including Shizuka, Crystal TaiTai and others.\nThe autogen for this mode has been rewritten by Jousway to include a more TaiTai aware selection of notes, so that we do not get odd holds/overlaps in things. Give it a try!\ngddm This release sees the long awaited updates to our gddm mode!\nThe lane drawing has been fixed, so that notes or \u0026lsquo;chips\u0026rsquo; as they are referred to display correctly, and we have properly sorted out the \u0026lsquo;merged\u0026rsquo; lane support.\nWe have planned to \u0026lsquo;straddle\u0026rsquo; support for the DTXMania NX/Ver. K layouts for the specified channels from the documentation, as these appear to be the most popular branches of this. A detailed channel support list will follow later on.\nAs of this build we have fixed loading .DTX files and these support most of the DRUM based side of the loading, see the table below. This will be improved in time, as we get better knowledge of this system.\nWe also support the \u0026lsquo;combined\u0026rsquo; lane system which adds lane 2 and lane 3\u0026rsquo;s extra notes, and Real mode (again, REAL filenames are yet to be parsed as such, the engine makes a \u0026lsquo;guess\u0026rsquo; on this!)\ngddm still needs a lot of work, and optimisation before we will consider it \u0026lsquo;ready\u0026rsquo;, so do expect the odd quirk or weird behaviour, and let us know what you think/would like to see as we define the mode and it\u0026rsquo;s featureset and support. we will be working on the gdgf parser in the coming months so that the guitar/bass charts will work as well.\nWe do not support XA file decoding at this time, we are looking into options. If you have a dtx file with XA files contained, they will just be played as silence, but won\u0026rsquo;t crash the game.

Makes it easier to find things you need, and please give us feedback if you feel a mode needs more representing/love!\nMac OS builds are now signed! We have finally passed all the requirements to be able to sign the binary, so this means no more xattr stuff anymore! we just act like any other application.\nMode Status: New Cross Platform MIDI Driver! Due to the interest we had been getting from the past two alpha releases in the form of gddm and techno, several players that were not on windows did enquire about the possibility of there being a new MIDI driver available for Mac and Linux users to make use of for their midi fighters, e-drums, etc and we decided as a team to move forward and produce one.\nThe midi driver stands alone, there is no need to have any extra applications \u0026rsquo;translating\u0026rsquo; it to keystrokes, (unless you\u0026rsquo;re doing midi via an iphone or something like that of course), but native midi controllers work a treat. If you have a midi device and want to try this out, you will need to load up your preferences.ini in your save folder, locate the inputdrivers= part, and then make sure it looks like this inputdrivers=portmidi,SDL\nThis will allow the midi driver to load, and set up your device. We have currently coded it for a single device at a time, but do let us know if you feel there is a need for multiple device support, or if you find a device that doesn\u0026rsquo;t behave!\nI also was able to make a prototype mini FSR pad for midi using a teensy LC and some tiny FSR sensors:\nThis worked a treat, so you can definitely get on to some tinkering if you want to make your own devices to play the game!\nThis driver works on Windows, Linux, RPi, Mac OS (intel) / Mac OS (M1) and Rockchip aarch64 SoCs We are still working on latency and control, so let us know if you find anything quirky!\nWindows legacy input driver There has also been work done on a small side part of the game, while we have been waiting for a fix from upstream in regards to the \u0026lsquo;polling/framerate\u0026rsquo; issue that a lot of folks have helping us diagnose for some time. The long and the short of the issue, it meant on some songs, the input would skew towards the update loop rather than honouring it\u0026rsquo;s timestamp, thus producing \u0026lsquo;spikes\u0026rsquo; on the scoring graph at the end of the song, and make a odd looking \u0026lsquo;stair\u0026rsquo; display on the scatter plot of the steps and judgements taken.\nTo resolve this while we\u0026rsquo;re waiting a fix, we have reimplemented the old legacy driver that was on 5.2/5.1 and adapted it for OutFox. This driver can be tempremental, but it seemed to behave with the devices we tested it with. If you tend to find that your input is affected with the message loop issue, you can set up the driver with the following instructions.\nYou will need to load up your preferences.ini in your save folder, locate the inputdrivers= part, and then make sure it looks like this inputdrivers=legacy,minisdl\n(if you wish to use the new portmidi driver as well you can use InputDrivers=legacy,minisdl,portmidi)\nThis will allow you to run the game with minimal resources, keeping vsync on, and should remove any previous issues of fps/rate/polling problems. When we have the fix from upstream, we\u0026rsquo;ll revisit and modernise this with the newer drivers and processes.\nOn the \u0026rsquo;test input\u0026rsquo; screen, you will see a new Window Handler \u0026lsquo;Aux\u0026rsquo; driver. This is just the driver that manages the window controls, maximises, fullscreens, etc, so no need to worry about it. This will also show you, that you have the correct drivers selected in the inputdrivers setting.\nRate and Pitch Changes: Due to an overwhelming set of requests, we have taken time to fix and modernise the rate/haste system which had been broken for a bit since this project began.\nPitch seemed to be a lottery (though we had not seen it work) and all the rate mod used to do was seemingly speed up the song with no other effect or option being honoured.\nSimilarly, we have moved the ratemod to the first screen of the song options - thanks to the stamina players that popped in to request this, and to mattm for saying that most wanted a speed AND pitch option, which we have called \u0026lsquo;both\u0026rsquo; internally to signify this change.\nThe new layout looks like so:\nWe have fixed the way the off/speed/pitch/speed and pitch options work, so they actually work. This took quite a bit of time to fix the internal pipelines for these, but the end effect is definitely fun. Thanks to Squirrel, Jousway and Jose for bringing this one up the pipeline to get it done for this release!\nTo ensure compatibility with legacy themes, the system \u0026lsquo;defaults\u0026rsquo; to how it was in 5.0.12, with a 0.01x increase, and being on the main menu as folks requested. This is a long overdue Quality of Life update for this, so we\u0026rsquo;re really pleased it\u0026rsquo;s done.\nKNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.9.9 ❕❌ ISSUE gh mode: Some charts have no real \u0026lsquo;standard\u0026rsquo; and will cause a crash when loaded into the game ❕❌ ISSUE techno/popn/gdgf/gddm/gh/para mode: Trying to use the sync audio screen will crash the game - Use dance to sync your game for now ❕❌ ISSUE gddm mode: We do not support the XA codec at this time, it\u0026rsquo;ll play silent. ❕❌ ISSUE beat/popn/gddm some early (pre2013) songs may play some sound samples / keysounds at the wrong speed Full Changelog Follows: ALL: Mode Specific\n❕✅ Fixed DTX Detection of track/lane sizes overflowing the notefield ❕✅ Fixed BMS/DTX/PMS Keysound iterator edge crash ❕✅ New!

Sometimes having a monthly release schedule is awesome, but it does tire us out!\nAnyways\u0026hellip; Lets get back to the update.\nThis mini hotfix (v2) includes a few things we were going to leave to the next release, but as we had to fix bugs in them anyway, it was easier to apply.\nALL: ❕✅ Fixed SM hash corruption ❕✅ Fixed DWI being loaded due to lazy people not cleaning their simfile folders ❕✅ The system will not load DWI if an ssc or sm is found ❕✅ Fixed odd SM title bug ❕✅ Fixed Crash with older hardware not supporting what it advertises ❕✅ Fixed Crash with course loading that affected some folks with \u0026gt;640 songs ❕✅ Fixed Notesloader issues with Mac and Linux ❕✅ Fixed GCC / Mac compile ❕✅ Fixed Windows 10/11 affinity issues ❕✅ Fixed Occasional spike on Windows 10/11 when using an XInput controller ❕✅ Taiko adjustments for notefield ❕✅ Fixed SM/SSC loading to be more cabinet friendly. Signed Mac builds update! The big news is we (now finally!) have passed the prerequisites for GateKeeper on Mac, so this hotfix should behave and work fine, without any issues. Do remember to just drag and drop as the dmg lets you know how to do so, and it will run as other applications. Thanks to Jose and Squirrel for their efforts, and Jose for puzzling through, and Jousway for fixing one of the bugs in gh mode which was causing issuess as well.\nNotes Loading There were several issues with the notes loaders and how antivirus/software protection apps were seeing OutFox when we were loading simfiles. This alpha hotfix now has addressed this by allowing you all to add more than one simfile in a song folder, cutting down on the folder rabbit hole. As we move to a more multi-game engine, this will also allow you to keep things tidy on your drive, and ensure it is a seamless experience for you all. Of course, please check the audio files are the same for the chart you are going to add to the folder, as you may find you have a nasty sync issue, but we also now support multidifficulty setups, as this is required for pump and taiko specifically.\nDifficulty System Revamp This hotfix also sees a tweak to the difficulty system used in OutFox. In the past it was tied to the DDR paradigm and then left to rot as one of those \u0026lsquo;StepMania Things\u0026rsquo;. This however really stifled what we could do within the engine, especially with modes with different names/brackets etc. With the release of gddm and taiko we needed more difficulties than the game offered, so this has now been resolved. Themes which are based off of 5.1/5.0.x will still work due to the numbers being the same as before. If there are any issues with your theme, do let us know, but we have tested several with no issues.\nNew #VOLUME and #PAN These features have been missing from our keysound support since 2002, and we are proud to say that we have them in this hotfix! They are completely supported in gddm from the parser, (do reset your cache of course!) and they also work in beat/popn. taiko will need the support as well, so shout out to Jous for putting up with my waaaahh-luigi on getting it added to the game. This build also supports the hidden chips/keysounds for gddm and we\u0026rsquo;ll work on getting the final compatibility added in due course.\nNew gh Modernisation Due to the need to run with a slightly more secure runtime on Mac OS Catalina/Big Sur/Monterey on the Intel based macs there were some functions in our gh mode which gatekeeper did not approve of. The way the notes were cast have been fixed, fever/star power has been sorted to be more gh3 like, and taps and open strums are also tweaked to be better. Please give them a try and let us know! A theme for this mode is in the works, so apologies for the barebone approach we have at the moment. It\u0026rsquo;s also why we are an alpha after all\u0026hellip;\nALL: Mode Specific\n❕✅ Fixed SM/SSC Noteloader corruption with some Japanese and Korean Titles/Artists on dance notesloaders ❕✅ Fixed DTX Noteloader memory leak ❕✅ Fixed DTX Parser missing some drums in gddm mode ❕✅ Fixed BMS Keysounds not seeking/reading correctly ❕✅ Fixed PMS Keysounds not buffering correctly ❕✅ Modernise Keysound system to prevent buffer under-runs ❕✅ Fix BMS/PMS missing channels, Hidden notes will come next Alpha ❕✅ Fix beat crash with charts that had more than 866 keysounds ❕✅ Fix popn crash with charts that had more than 1022 keysounds ❕✅ Fix #VOLUME not being applied correctly to beat and gddm keysounds ❕✅ Fix #PAN not being applied to beat and popn keysounds ❕✅ Fix gh loading crash with some older charts. ❕✅ Fixed RageSound preload causing missing chips in gddm and notes in beat ❕✅ Fixed gh crash due to an overzealous lightsman double update ❕✅ Fixed crash in DTX/BMS/PMS due to strings being over optimised on Mac Intel/Linux ❕✅ Fixed gh note types to please the Mac OS gatekeeper gods ❕✅ Fixed gh open strum notes ❕✅ Fixed gh fever to be closer to gh3 ❕✅ New gh HOPO notes system ❕✅ Fixed gh tap notes not showing up sometimes on older CHART files Engine\n❕✅ Fixed Screen msg Bug - Closes 17 year old issue ❕✅ Fixed crash in Jukebox with non-dance modes ❕✅ Fixed overflow in tween awareness - Closes 14 year old issue ❕✅ Fixed Actor overflow on tween actions - Closes 14 year old issue ❕✅ Fixed OptionsPrefs issue - Closes #375 ❕✅ Fixed editor scrolling issue ❕✅ Fixed editor buffer overflow when using \u0026gt;496 keysounds ❕✅ Fixed editor input being sent garbage ❕✅ Fixed editor input parser arrays ❕✅ Fixed crash in practice mode ❕✅ Fixed endless loop with some older BMS/PMS charts in practice mode - Thanks EDMSPack ❕✅ Fixed potential buffer overflow exploit in soundreader ❕✅ Fixed keysounds being stopped when they didn\u0026rsquo;t need to be, forcing a reload of the sound ❕✅ Fixed Keysound index system ❕✅ New Added save on exit theme metrics for option screens ❕✅ Fixed freeze on game select screen due to missing module - Thanks Kaede! ❕✅ Modernised the notesloader system in preparation for more loaders ❕✅ Fixed some types of charts being erroroneously skipped during the parse load ❕✅ NEW Multi Sim File Loading from 1 directory ❕✅ NEW Non DDR difficulty system so we can properly support other modes Linux\n❕✅ Fixed crash on linux versions that do not support the new Neutral Vendor libraries ❕✅ Fixed crash on Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora/Arch with inifile due to a race condition ❕✅ Fixed edge case crash on Clear/Fedora preventing the game booting on some 4.x / \u0026lt; 5.1 Kernels ARM32/ARM64: (Raspberry Pi etc)\n❕✅ Fixed edge case crash on Twister/Raspbian preventing the game booting on some 4.x Kernels ❕✅ Fixed crash on Raspbian with inifile due to a race condition ❕✅ Fixed crash on RockPi 4B/4C when not using the first HDMI port/Audio Mac OS\n❕✅ Fixed input with guitar hero based controllers ❕✅ Rewrote internal gh mode to fix overly harsh input restrictions ❕✅ Fixed internal system to be signed compliant ❕✅ New enhanced build pipeline to ensure signing passes on Mac OS Intel ❕✅ New streamlined and optimised code for Mac M1 now we are properly signed KNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.9.9HF ❕❌ ISSUE Song Charts will not pan the player correctly when being played ❕❌ ISSUE Playing beat/popnsongs on Endless Mode may have a crash on song loading.

Please find your save folder and delete the contents of /cache. This will make your first time run of 4.9.9 slightly longer as it has to rebuild the index, but it is to accommodate the new modes/setup etc. Please remember to restart the game after doing a cache build, so you do not have as many issues with memory management. New (and some Old!) Modes Update Version 2 Following on from the last release, we have continued to improve and revamp the note system for the new modes, with Jousway taking the time to make available new types and styles available that were never before. This month fixes some omissions we made from the last release, which slipped through the testing teams.\npump We have fixed the scoring bug that was in the previous build, and thank you for those who took the time to report the issues. Keep in mind that Soundwaves still uses \u0026lsquo;dance\u0026rsquo; paradigms for scoring, but other themes that use different scoring systems based on \u0026lsquo;pump/piu\u0026rsquo; should work correctly now.\nThe tick-count has been tweaked to work correctly as there was a miscalculation in the offset math inherited from upstream. This now behaves as expected.\nGetting random misses on hold heads has been resolved as well as the holds with small tails (mini/micro holds).\nSupport for co-op charts has been added. 5 player is introduced with up to 10 players support, though the noteskins have not been prepared at this time. The numbers on the noteskins are separately labeled so with a few adjustments and extra assets you will be able to update any noteskin to work with co-op. Co-op charts made on StepF2/StepP1 should work on OutFox, however, better note types are currently being developed by Jousway so that there can be more than 3 real players defined. Stay tuned!\nThose of you who have reported that we still have a \u0026lsquo;superb\u0026rsquo; bug on holds, this will be fixed when we introduce the new piu mode - remember the pump mode is getting Quality of Life updates for now, before we move over to updating things properly in the future.\nMicro/Miniholds also do not trigger misses/cause a weird tick to happen anymore, and there also are no \u0026lsquo;phantom\u0026rsquo; mines in long (5+ measure) holds - this was an oddity which has been fixed now.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re still working on improving SF2/SP1 custom charts parsing. Except for a few charts, you can play the majority of content made for it on OutFox with no problems. As always, if you find any oddities make sure you report them to us!\npopn There was also a reported issue where some of the channels (lanes) of the PMS 7 button mode were not parsing correctly, or were actually being missed completely, resulting in a chart \u0026lsquo;misplacing\u0026rsquo; green and blue lanes. This was due to Squirrel misreading the spec on how BMS98/PMS was transcribed and set up the function wrong. It is fixed in this release.\nWe also have added 18 lane mode (No PMS/(BME) File support yet though!)\nThank you to all of those that took the time to report this and to kick us into getting outfox into a proper BMS/PMS parser. There are still a few features missing from po-mu mode, but these will be added to the game as per the spec (see the table below for more information.)\npopn mode also had a few tweaks and adjustments this alpha mainly in how keysounds are loaded within the game. This should now mean the mode should be smoother overall.\nThanks to the channels being set right, we also are happy to announce another feature to \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; mode: 2 player! This was not available on the original client, but it did always irk us how there was never 2 player options other than 3 button battle. In a future update, there will be a battle mode for \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; but for now, enjoy the 2 player fun. We will finally be having a theme for \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; in OutFox really soon, so this is finally a move from the \u0026lsquo;dance\u0026rsquo; centric era of the application\u0026rsquo;s past.\nHave some fun with mod files from dance on popn-four\nbeat will be getting some attention this next quarter! para We have given this mode a polish (and for those with an arcade cab, with 3 sensors doing nothing!) we added the \u0026lsquo;fabled\u0026rsquo; 360, or 8 sensor mode. This mode was designed for in the arcade for when the player twirls or turns, but was never actioned. The sensors for the back are actually there! This mode adds that, and for those who feel adventurous, we will be publishing some information on how to make your own 360 8 sensor panel controller in due course.\ntaitai Announcing our 15th mode!\nTaiTai is based off of a popular game where you hit a drum in it\u0026rsquo;s face. The game is horizontally based, with the notes travelling from right to left, and you hit the drum when the note gets to the receptor. The orange notes are for the inner part of the drum, and the blue ones are for the outer rim of the drum.\nFor the moment, some of the quirkier parts of this mode are a work in progress, bear with us as we also write new parsers for this mode. We plan to add support for the special note types and other effects in the game, as well as improve timing and other bits and pieces that are still yet to do.\nOnce more, we have no theme for this yet! (We are an alpha after all!) However, we will have a theme available for this soon that will give the mode polish and a playable feel.\nWe still have the scoring and timing system to finish, along with effects on double notes/taps and the \u0026lsquo;roll\u0026rsquo; notes which you hit as much as you can. Feel free to give it a run and let us know what you think!\nThere is a collection of noteskins including Shizuka, Crystal TaiTai and others.\nThe autogen for this mode has been rewritten by Jousway to include a more TaiTai aware selection of notes, so that we do not get odd holds/overlaps in things. Give it a try!\ngddm This release sees the long awaited updates to our gddm mode!\nThe lane drawing has been fixed, so that notes or \u0026lsquo;chips\u0026rsquo; as they are referred to display correctly, and we have properly sorted out the \u0026lsquo;merged\u0026rsquo; lane support.\nWe have planned to \u0026lsquo;straddle\u0026rsquo; support for the DTXMania NX/Ver. K layouts for the specified channels from the documentation, as these appear to be the most popular branches of this. A detailed channel support list will follow later on.\nAs of this build we have fixed loading .DTX files and these support most of the DRUM based side of the loading, see the table below. This will be improved in time, as we get better knowledge of this system.\nWe also support the \u0026lsquo;combined\u0026rsquo; lane system which adds lane 2 and lane 3\u0026rsquo;s extra notes, and Real mode (again, REAL filenames are yet to be parsed as such, the engine makes a \u0026lsquo;guess\u0026rsquo; on this!)\ngddm still needs a lot of work, and optimisation before we will consider it \u0026lsquo;ready\u0026rsquo;, so do expect the odd quirk or weird behaviour, and let us know what you think/would like to see as we define the mode and it\u0026rsquo;s featureset and support. we will be working on the gdgf parser in the coming months so that the guitar/bass charts will work as well.\nWe do not support XA file decoding at this time, we are looking into options. If you have a dtx file with XA files contained, they will just be played as silence, but won\u0026rsquo;t crash the game.

Makes it easier to find things you need, and please give us feedback if you feel a mode needs more representing/love!\nMac OS builds are now signed! We have finally passed all the requirements to be able to sign the binary, so this means no more xattr stuff anymore! we just act like any other application.\nMode Status: New Cross Platform MIDI Driver! Due to the interest we had been getting from the past two alpha releases in the form of gddm and techno, several players that were not on windows did enquire about the possibility of there being a new MIDI driver available for Mac and Linux users to make use of for their midi fighters, e-drums, etc and we decided as a team to move forward and produce one.\nThe midi driver stands alone, there is no need to have any extra applications \u0026rsquo;translating\u0026rsquo; it to keystrokes, (unless you\u0026rsquo;re doing midi via an iphone or something like that of course), but native midi controllers work a treat. If you have a midi device and want to try this out, you will need to load up your preferences.ini in your save folder, locate the inputdrivers= part, and then make sure it looks like this inputdrivers=portmidi,SDL\nThis will allow the midi driver to load, and set up your device. We have currently coded it for a single device at a time, but do let us know if you feel there is a need for multiple device support, or if you find a device that doesn\u0026rsquo;t behave!\nI also was able to make a prototype mini FSR pad for midi using a teensy LC and some tiny FSR sensors:\nThis worked a treat, so you can definitely get on to some tinkering if you want to make your own devices to play the game!\nThis driver works on Windows, Linux, RPi, Mac OS (intel) / Mac OS (M1) and Rockchip aarch64 SoCs We are still working on latency and control, so let us know if you find anything quirky!\nWindows legacy input driver There has also been work done on a small side part of the game, while we have been waiting for a fix from upstream in regards to the \u0026lsquo;polling/framerate\u0026rsquo; issue that a lot of folks have helping us diagnose for some time. The long and the short of the issue, it meant on some songs, the input would skew towards the update loop rather than honouring it\u0026rsquo;s timestamp, thus producing \u0026lsquo;spikes\u0026rsquo; on the scoring graph at the end of the song, and make a odd looking \u0026lsquo;stair\u0026rsquo; display on the scatter plot of the steps and judgements taken.\nTo resolve this while we\u0026rsquo;re waiting a fix, we have reimplemented the old legacy driver that was on 5.2/5.1 and adapted it for OutFox. This driver can be tempremental, but it seemed to behave with the devices we tested it with. If you tend to find that your input is affected with the message loop issue, you can set up the driver with the following instructions.\nYou will need to load up your preferences.ini in your save folder, locate the inputdrivers= part, and then make sure it looks like this inputdrivers=legacy,minisdl\n(if you wish to use the new portmidi driver as well you can use InputDrivers=legacy,minisdl,portmidi)\nThis will allow you to run the game with minimal resources, keeping vsync on, and should remove any previous issues of fps/rate/polling problems. When we have the fix from upstream, we\u0026rsquo;ll revisit and modernise this with the newer drivers and processes.\nOn the \u0026rsquo;test input\u0026rsquo; screen, you will see a new Window Handler \u0026lsquo;Aux\u0026rsquo; driver. This is just the driver that manages the window controls, maximises, fullscreens, etc, so no need to worry about it. This will also show you, that you have the correct drivers selected in the inputdrivers setting.\nRate and Pitch Changes: Due to an overwhelming set of requests, we have taken time to fix and modernise the rate/haste system which had been broken for a bit since this project began.\nPitch seemed to be a lottery (though we had not seen it work) and all the rate mod used to do was seemingly speed up the song with no other effect or option being honoured.\nSimilarly, we have moved the ratemod to the first screen of the song options - thanks to the stamina players that popped in to request this, and to mattm for saying that most wanted a speed AND pitch option, which we have called \u0026lsquo;both\u0026rsquo; internally to signify this change.\nThe new layout looks like so:\nWe have fixed the way the off/speed/pitch/speed and pitch options work, so they actually work. This took quite a bit of time to fix the internal pipelines for these, but the end effect is definitely fun. Thanks to Squirrel, Jousway and Jose for bringing this one up the pipeline to get it done for this release!\nTo ensure compatibility with legacy themes, the system \u0026lsquo;defaults\u0026rsquo; to how it was in 5.0.12, with a 0.01x increase, and being on the main menu as folks requested. This is a long overdue Quality of Life update for this, so we\u0026rsquo;re really pleased it\u0026rsquo;s done.\nKNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.9.9 ❕❌ ISSUE gh mode: Some charts have no real \u0026lsquo;standard\u0026rsquo; and will cause a crash when loaded into the game ❕❌ ISSUE techno/popn/gdgf/gddm/gh/para mode: Trying to use the sync audio screen will crash the game - Use dance to sync your game for now ❕❌ ISSUE gddm mode: We do not support the XA codec at this time, it\u0026rsquo;ll play silent. ❕❌ ISSUE beat/popn/gddm some early (pre2013) songs may play some sound samples / keysounds at the wrong speed Full Changelog Follows: ALL: Mode Specific\n❕✅ Fixed DTX Detection of track/lane sizes overflowing the notefield ❕✅ Fixed BMS/DTX/PMS Keysound iterator edge crash ❕✅ New!

Sometimes having a monthly release schedule is awesome, but it does tire us out!\nAnyways\u0026hellip; Lets get back to the update.\nThis mini hotfix includes a few things we were going to leave to the next release, but as we had to fix bugs in them anyway, it was easier to apply.\nSigned Mac builds update! The big news is we (now finally!) have passed the prerequisites for GateKeeper on Mac, so this hotfix should behave and work fine, without any issues. Do remember to just drag and drop as the dmg lets you know how to do so, and it will run as other applications. Thanks to Jose and Squirrel for their efforts, and Jose for puzzling through, and Jousway for fixing one of the bugs in gh mode which was causing issuess as well.\nNotes Loading There were several issues with the notes loaders and how antivirus/software protection apps were seeing OutFox when we were loading simfiles. This alpha hotfix now has addressed this by allowing you all to add more than one simfile in a song folder, cutting down on the folder rabbit hole. As we move to a more multi-game engine, this will also allow you to keep things tidy on your drive, and ensure it is a seamless experience for you all. Of course, please check the audio files are the same for the chart you are going to add to the folder, as you may find you have a nasty sync issue, but we also now support multidifficulty setups, as this is required for pump and taiko specifically.\nDifficulty System Revamp This hotfix also sees a tweak to the difficulty system used in OutFox. In the past it was tied to the DDR paradigm and then left to rot as one of those \u0026lsquo;StepMania Things\u0026rsquo;. This however really stifled what we could do within the engine, especially with modes with different names/brackets etc. With the release of gddm and taiko we needed more difficulties than the game offered, so this has now been resolved. Themes which are based off of 5.1/5.0.x will still work due to the numbers being the same as before. If there are any issues with your theme, do let us know, but we have tested several with no issues.\nNew #VOLUME and #PAN These features have been missing from our keysound support since 2002, and we are proud to say that we have them in this hotfix! They are completely supported in gddm from the parser, (do reset your cache of course!) and they also work in beat/popn. taiko will need the support as well, so shout out to Jous for putting up with my waaaahh-luigi on getting it added to the game. This build also supports the hidden chips/keysounds for gddm and we\u0026rsquo;ll work on getting the final compatibility added in due course.\nNew gh Modernisation Due to the need to run with a slightly more secure runtime on Mac OS Catalina/Big Sur/Monterey on the Intel based macs there were some functions in our gh mode which gatekeeper did not approve of. The way the notes were cast have been fixed, fever/star power has been sorted to be more gh3 like, and taps and open strums are also tweaked to be better. Please give them a try and let us know! A theme for this mode is in the works, so apologies for the barebone approach we have at the moment.

New (and some Old!) Modes Update Version 2 Following on from the last release, we have continued to improve and revamp the note system for the new modes, with Jousway taking the time to make available new types and styles available that were never before. This month fixes some omissions we made from the last release, which slipped through the testing teams.\npump We have fixed the scoring bug that was in the previous build, and thank you for those who took the time to report the issues. Keep in mind that Soundwaves still uses \u0026lsquo;dance\u0026rsquo; paradigms for scoring, but other themes that use different scoring systems based on \u0026lsquo;pump/piu\u0026rsquo; should work correctly now.\nThe tick-count has been tweaked to work correctly as there was a miscalculation in the offset math inherited from upstream. This now behaves as expected.\nGetting random misses on hold heads has been resolved as well as the holds with small tails (mini/micro holds).\nSupport for co-op charts has been added. 5 player is introduced with up to 10 players support, though the noteskins have not been prepared at this time. The numbers on the noteskins are separately labeled so with a few adjustments and extra assets you will be able to update any noteskin to work with co-op. Co-op charts made on StepF2/StepP1 should work on OutFox, however, better note types are currently being developed by Jousway so that there can be more than 3 real players defined. Stay tuned!\nThose of you who have reported that we still have a \u0026lsquo;superb\u0026rsquo; bug on holds, this will be fixed when we introduce the new piu mode - remember the pump mode is getting Quality of Life updates for now, before we move over to updating things properly in the future.\nMicro/Miniholds also do not trigger misses/cause a weird tick to happen anymore, and there also are no \u0026lsquo;phantom\u0026rsquo; mines in long (5+ measure) holds - this was an oddity which has been fixed now.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re still working on improving SF2/SP1 custom charts parsing. Except for a few charts, you can play the majority of content made for it on OutFox with no problems. As always, if you find any oddities make sure you report them to us!\npopn There was also a reported issue where some of the channels (lanes) of the PMS 7 button mode were not parsing correctly, or were actually being missed completely, resulting in a chart \u0026lsquo;misplacing\u0026rsquo; green and blue lanes. This was due to Squirrel misreading the spec on how BMS98/PMS was transcribed and set up the function wrong. It is fixed in this release.\nWe also have added 18 lane mode (No PMS/(BME) File support yet though!)\nThank you to all of those that took the time to report this and to kick us into getting outfox into a proper BMS/PMS parser. There are still a few features missing from po-mu mode, but these will be added to the game as per the spec (see the table below for more information.)\npopn mode also had a few tweaks and adjustments this alpha mainly in how keysounds are loaded within the game. This should now mean the mode should be smoother overall.\nThanks to the channels being set right, we also are happy to announce another feature to \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; mode: 2 player! This was not available on the original client, but it did always irk us how there was never 2 player options other than 3 button battle. In a future update, there will be a battle mode for \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; but for now, enjoy the 2 player fun. We will finally be having a theme for \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; in OutFox really soon, so this is finally a move from the \u0026lsquo;dance\u0026rsquo; centric era of the application\u0026rsquo;s past.\nHave some fun with mod files from dance on popn-four\nbeat will be getting some attention this next quarter! para We have given this mode a polish (and for those with an arcade cab, with 3 sensors doing nothing!) we added the \u0026lsquo;fabled\u0026rsquo; 360, or 8 sensor mode. This mode was designed for in the arcade for when the player twirls or turns, but was never actioned. The sensors for the back are actually there! This mode adds that, and for those who feel adventurous, we will be publishing some information on how to make your own 360 8 sensor panel controller in due course.\ntaitai Announcing our 15th mode!\nTaiTai is based off of a popular game where you hit a drum in it\u0026rsquo;s face. The game is horizontally based, with the notes travelling from right to left, and you hit the drum when the note gets to the receptor. The orange notes are for the inner part of the drum, and the blue ones are for the outer rim of the drum.\nFor the moment, some of the quirkier parts of this mode are a work in progress, bear with us as we also write new parsers for this mode. We plan to add support for the special note types and other effects in the game, as well as improve timing and other bits and pieces that are still yet to do.\nOnce more, we have no theme for this yet! (We are an alpha after all!) However, we will have a theme available for this soon that will give the mode polish and a playable feel.\nWe still have the scoring and timing system to finish, along with effects on double notes/taps and the \u0026lsquo;roll\u0026rsquo; notes which you hit as much as you can. Feel free to give it a run and let us know what you think!\nThere is a collection of noteskins including Shizuka, Crystal TaiTai and others.\nThe autogen for this mode has been rewritten by Jousway to include a more TaiTai aware selection of notes, so that we do not get odd holds/overlaps in things. Give it a try!\ngddm This release sees the long awaited updates to our gddm mode!\nThe lane drawing has been fixed, so that notes or \u0026lsquo;chips\u0026rsquo; as they are referred to display correctly, and we have properly sorted out the \u0026lsquo;merged\u0026rsquo; lane support.\nWe have planned to \u0026lsquo;straddle\u0026rsquo; support for the DTXMania NX/Ver. K layouts for the specified channels from the documentation, as these appear to be the most popular branches of this. A detailed channel support list will follow later on.\nAs of this build we have fixed loading .DTX files and these support most of the DRUM based side of the loading, see the table below. This will be improved in time, as we get better knowledge of this system.\nWe also support the \u0026lsquo;combined\u0026rsquo; lane system which adds lane 2 and lane 3\u0026rsquo;s extra notes, and Real mode (again, REAL filenames are yet to be parsed as such, the engine makes a \u0026lsquo;guess\u0026rsquo; on this!)\ngddm still needs a lot of work, and optimisation before we will consider it \u0026lsquo;ready\u0026rsquo;, so do expect the odd quirk or weird behaviour, and let us know what you think/would like to see as we define the mode and it\u0026rsquo;s featureset and support. we will be working on the gdgf parser in the coming months so that the guitar/bass charts will work as well.\nWe do not support XA file decoding at this time, we are looking into options. If you have a dtx file with XA files contained, they will just be played as silence, but won\u0026rsquo;t crash the game.

Makes it easier to find things you need, and please give us feedback if you feel a mode needs more representing/love!\nMac OS builds are now signed! We have finally passed all the requirements to be able to sign the binary, so this means no more xattr stuff anymore! we just act like any other application.\nMode Status: New Cross Platform MIDI Driver! Due to the interest we had been getting from the past two alpha releases in the form of gddm and techno, several players that were not on windows did enquire about the possibility of there being a new MIDI driver available for Mac and Linux users to make use of for their midi fighters, e-drums, etc and we decided as a team to move forward and produce one.\nThe midi driver stands alone, there is no need to have any extra applications \u0026rsquo;translating\u0026rsquo; it to keystrokes, (unless you\u0026rsquo;re doing midi via an iphone or something like that of course), but native midi controllers work a treat. If you have a midi device and want to try this out, you will need to load up your preferences.ini in your save folder, locate the inputdrivers= part, and then make sure it looks like this inputdrivers=portmidi,SDL\nThis will allow the midi driver to load, and set up your device. We have currently coded it for a single device at a time, but do let us know if you feel there is a need for multiple device support, or if you find a device that doesn\u0026rsquo;t behave!\nI also was able to make a prototype mini FSR pad for midi using a teensy LC and some tiny FSR sensors:\nThis worked a treat, so you can definitely get on to some tinkering if you want to make your own devices to play the game!\nThis driver works on Windows, Linux, RPi, Mac OS (intel) / Mac OS (M1) and Rockchip aarch64 SoCs We are still working on latency and control, so let us know if you find anything quirky!\nWindows legacy input driver There has also been work done on a small side part of the game, while we have been waiting for a fix from upstream in regards to the \u0026lsquo;polling/framerate\u0026rsquo; issue that a lot of folks have helping us diagnose for some time. The long and the short of the issue, it meant on some songs, the input would skew towards the update loop rather than honouring it\u0026rsquo;s timestamp, thus producing \u0026lsquo;spikes\u0026rsquo; on the scoring graph at the end of the song, and make a odd looking \u0026lsquo;stair\u0026rsquo; display on the scatter plot of the steps and judgements taken.\nTo resolve this while we\u0026rsquo;re waiting a fix, we have reimplemented the old legacy driver that was on 5.2/5.1 and adapted it for OutFox. This driver can be tempremental, but it seemed to behave with the devices we tested it with. If you tend to find that your input is affected with the message loop issue, you can set up the driver with the following instructions.\nYou will need to load up your preferences.ini in your save folder, locate the inputdrivers= part, and then make sure it looks like this inputdrivers=legacy,minisdl\n(if you wish to use the new portmidi driver as well you can use InputDrivers=legacy,minisdl,portmidi)\nThis will allow you to run the game with minimal resources, keeping vsync on, and should remove any previous issues of fps/rate/polling problems. When we have the fix from upstream, we\u0026rsquo;ll revisit and modernise this with the newer drivers and processes.\nOn the \u0026rsquo;test input\u0026rsquo; screen, you will see a new Window Handler \u0026lsquo;Aux\u0026rsquo; driver. This is just the driver that manages the window controls, maximises, fullscreens, etc, so no need to worry about it. This will also show you, that you have the correct drivers selected in the inputdrivers setting.\nRate and Pitch Changes: Due to an overwhelming set of requests, we have taken time to fix and modernise the rate/haste system which had been broken for a bit since this project began.\nPitch seemed to be a lottery (though we had not seen it work) and all the rate mod used to do was seemingly speed up the song with no other effect or option being honoured.\nSimilarly, we have moved the ratemod to the first screen of the song options - thanks to the stamina players that popped in to request this, and to mattm for saying that most wanted a speed AND pitch option, which we have called \u0026lsquo;both\u0026rsquo; internally to signify this change.\nThe new layout looks like so:\nWe have fixed the way the off/speed/pitch/speed and pitch options work, so they actually work. This took quite a bit of time to fix the internal pipelines for these, but the end effect is definitely fun. Thanks to Squirrel, Jousway and Jose for bringing this one up the pipeline to get it done for this release!\nTo ensure compatibility with legacy themes, the system \u0026lsquo;defaults\u0026rsquo; to how it was in 5.0.12, with a 0.01x increase, and being on the main menu as folks requested. This is a long overdue Quality of Life update for this, so we\u0026rsquo;re really pleased it\u0026rsquo;s done.\nKNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.9.9 ❕❌ ISSUE gh mode: Some charts have no real \u0026lsquo;standard\u0026rsquo; and will cause a crash when loaded into the game ❕❌ ISSUE techno/popn/gdgf/gddm/gh/para mode: Trying to use the sync audio screen will crash the game - Use dance to sync your game for now ❕❌ ISSUE gddm mode: We do not support the XA codec at this time, it\u0026rsquo;ll play silent. ❕❌ ISSUE beat/popn/gddm some early (pre2013) songs may play some sound samples / keysounds at the wrong speed Full Changelog Follows: ALL: Mode Specific\n❕✅ Fixed DTX Detection of track/lane sizes overflowing the notefield ❕✅ Fixed BMS/DTX/PMS Keysound iterator edge crash ❕✅ New!

Please find your save folder and delete the contents of /cache. This will make your first time run of 4.9.9 slightly longer as it has to rebuild the index, but it is to accommodate the new modes/setup etc. Please remember to restart the game after doing a cache build, so you do not have as many issues with memory management. New (and some Old!) Modes Update Version 2 Following on from the last release, we have continued to improve and revamp the note system for the new modes, with Jousway taking the time to make available new types and styles available that were never before. This month fixes some omissions we made from the last release, which slipped through the testing teams.\npump We have fixed the scoring bug that was in the previous build, and thank you for those who took the time to report the issues. Keep in mind that Soundwaves still uses \u0026lsquo;dance\u0026rsquo; paradigms for scoring, but other themes that use different scoring systems based on \u0026lsquo;pump/piu\u0026rsquo; should work correctly now.\nThe tick-count has been tweaked to work correctly as there was a miscalculation in the offset math inherited from upstream. This now behaves as expected.\nGetting random misses on hold heads has been resolved as well as the holds with small tails (mini/micro holds).\nSupport for co-op charts has been added. 5 player is introduced with up to 10 players support, though the noteskins have not been prepared at this time. The numbers on the noteskins are separately labeled so with a few adjustments and extra assets you will be able to update any noteskin to work with co-op. Co-op charts made on StepF2/StepP1 should work on OutFox, however, better note types are currently being developed by Jousway so that there can be more than 3 real players defined. Stay tuned!\nThose of you who have reported that we still have a \u0026lsquo;superb\u0026rsquo; bug on holds, this will be fixed when we introduce the new piu mode - remember the pump mode is getting Quality of Life updates for now, before we move over to updating things properly in the future.\nMicro/Miniholds also do not trigger misses/cause a weird tick to happen anymore, and there also are no \u0026lsquo;phantom\u0026rsquo; mines in long (5+ measure) holds - this was an oddity which has been fixed now.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re still working on improving SF2/SP1 custom charts parsing. Except for a few charts, you can play the majority of content made for it on OutFox with no problems. As always, if you find any oddities make sure you report them to us!\npopn There was also a reported issue where some of the channels (lanes) of the PMS 7 button mode were not parsing correctly, or were actually being missed completely, resulting in a chart \u0026lsquo;misplacing\u0026rsquo; green and blue lanes. This was due to Squirrel misreading the spec on how BMS98/PMS was transcribed and set up the function wrong. It is fixed in this release.\nWe also have added 18 lane mode (No PMS/(BME) File support yet though!)\nThank you to all of those that took the time to report this and to kick us into getting outfox into a proper BMS/PMS parser. There are still a few features missing from po-mu mode, but these will be added to the game as per the spec (see the table below for more information.)\npopn mode also had a few tweaks and adjustments this alpha mainly in how keysounds are loaded within the game. This should now mean the mode should be smoother overall.\nThanks to the channels being set right, we also are happy to announce another feature to \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; mode: 2 player! This was not available on the original client, but it did always irk us how there was never 2 player options other than 3 button battle. In a future update, there will be a battle mode for \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; but for now, enjoy the 2 player fun. We will finally be having a theme for \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; in OutFox really soon, so this is finally a move from the \u0026lsquo;dance\u0026rsquo; centric era of the application\u0026rsquo;s past.\nHave some fun with mod files from dance on popn-four\nbeat will be getting some attention this next quarter! para We have given this mode a polish (and for those with an arcade cab, with 3 sensors doing nothing!) we added the \u0026lsquo;fabled\u0026rsquo; 360, or 8 sensor mode. This mode was designed for in the arcade for when the player twirls or turns, but was never actioned. The sensors for the back are actually there! This mode adds that, and for those who feel adventurous, we will be publishing some information on how to make your own 360 8 sensor panel controller in due course.\ntaitai Announcing our 15th mode!\nTaiTai is based off of a popular game where you hit a drum in it\u0026rsquo;s face. The game is horizontally based, with the notes travelling from right to left, and you hit the drum when the note gets to the receptor. The orange notes are for the inner part of the drum, and the blue ones are for the outer rim of the drum.\nFor the moment, some of the quirkier parts of this mode are a work in progress, bear with us as we also write new parsers for this mode. We plan to add support for the special note types and other effects in the game, as well as improve timing and other bits and pieces that are still yet to do.\nOnce more, we have no theme for this yet! (We are an alpha after all!) However, we will have a theme available for this soon that will give the mode polish and a playable feel.\nWe still have the scoring and timing system to finish, along with effects on double notes/taps and the \u0026lsquo;roll\u0026rsquo; notes which you hit as much as you can. Feel free to give it a run and let us know what you think!\nThere is a collection of noteskins including Shizuka, Crystal TaiTai and others.\nThe autogen for this mode has been rewritten by Jousway to include a more TaiTai aware selection of notes, so that we do not get odd holds/overlaps in things. Give it a try!\ngddm This release sees the long awaited updates to our gddm mode!\nThe lane drawing has been fixed, so that notes or \u0026lsquo;chips\u0026rsquo; as they are referred to display correctly, and we have properly sorted out the \u0026lsquo;merged\u0026rsquo; lane support.\nWe have planned to \u0026lsquo;straddle\u0026rsquo; support for the DTXMania NX/Ver. K layouts for the specified channels from the documentation, as these appear to be the most popular branches of this. A detailed channel support list will follow later on.\nAs of this build we have fixed loading .DTX files and these support most of the DRUM based side of the loading, see the table below. This will be improved in time, as we get better knowledge of this system.\nWe also support the \u0026lsquo;combined\u0026rsquo; lane system which adds lane 2 and lane 3\u0026rsquo;s extra notes, and Real mode (again, REAL filenames are yet to be parsed as such, the engine makes a \u0026lsquo;guess\u0026rsquo; on this!)\ngddm still needs a lot of work, and optimisation before we will consider it \u0026lsquo;ready\u0026rsquo;, so do expect the odd quirk or weird behaviour, and let us know what you think/would like to see as we define the mode and it\u0026rsquo;s featureset and support. we will be working on the gdgf parser in the coming months so that the guitar/bass charts will work as well.\nWe do not support XA file decoding at this time, we are looking into options. If you have a dtx file with XA files contained, they will just be played as silence, but won\u0026rsquo;t crash the game. We do support the #PAN and #VOLUME tags, (shoutout to Jous!) we managed to get this in before the release.

Makes it easier to find things you need, and please give us feedback if you feel a mode needs more representing/love!\nMac OS builds are now signed! We have finally passed all the requirements to be able to sign the binary, so this means no more xattr stuff anymore! we just act like any other application.\nMode Status: New Cross Platform MIDI Driver! Due to the interest we had been getting from the past two alpha releases in the form of gddm and techno, several players that were not on windows did enquire about the possibility of there being a new MIDI driver available for Mac and Linux users to make use of for their midi fighters, e-drums, etc and we decided as a team to move forward and produce one.\nThe midi driver stands alone, there is no need to have any extra applications \u0026rsquo;translating\u0026rsquo; it to keystrokes, (unless you\u0026rsquo;re doing midi via an iphone or something like that of course), but native midi controllers work a treat. If you have a midi device and want to try this out, you will need to load up your preferences.ini in your save folder, locate the inputdrivers= part, and then make sure it looks like this inputdrivers=portmidi,SDL\nThis will allow the midi driver to load, and set up your device. We have currently coded it for a single device at a time, but do let us know if you feel there is a need for multiple device support, or if you find a device that doesn\u0026rsquo;t behave!\nI also was able to make a prototype mini FSR pad for midi using a teensy LC and some tiny FSR sensors:\nThis worked a treat, so you can definitely get on to some tinkering if you want to make your own devices to play the game!\nThis driver works on Windows, Linux, RPi, Mac OS (intel) / Mac OS (M1) and Rockchip aarch64 SoCs We are still working on latency and control, so let us know if you find anything quirky!\nWindows legacy input driver There has also been work done on a small side part of the game, while we have been waiting for a fix from upstream in regards to the \u0026lsquo;polling/framerate\u0026rsquo; issue that a lot of folks have helping us diagnose for some time. The long and the short of the issue, it meant on some songs, the input would skew towards the update loop rather than honouring it\u0026rsquo;s timestamp, thus producing \u0026lsquo;spikes\u0026rsquo; on the scoring graph at the end of the song, and make a odd looking \u0026lsquo;stair\u0026rsquo; display on the scatter plot of the steps and judgements taken.\nTo resolve this while we\u0026rsquo;re waiting a fix, we have reimplemented the old legacy driver that was on 5.2/5.1 and adapted it for OutFox. This driver can be tempremental, but it seemed to behave with the devices we tested it with. If you tend to find that your input is affected with the message loop issue, you can set up the driver with the following instructions.\nYou will need to load up your preferences.ini in your save folder, locate the inputdrivers= part, and then make sure it looks like this inputdrivers=legacy,minisdl\n(if you wish to use the new portmidi driver as well you can use InputDrivers=legacy,minisdl,portmidi)\nThis will allow you to run the game with minimal resources, keeping vsync on, and should remove any previous issues of fps/rate/polling problems. When we have the fix from upstream, we\u0026rsquo;ll revisit and modernise this with the newer drivers and processes.\nOn the \u0026rsquo;test input\u0026rsquo; screen, you will see a new Window Handler \u0026lsquo;Aux\u0026rsquo; driver. This is just the driver that manages the window controls, maximises, fullscreens, etc, so no need to worry about it. This will also show you, that you have the correct drivers selected in the inputdrivers setting.\nRate and Pitch Changes: Due to an overwhelming set of requests, we have taken time to fix and modernise the rate/haste system which had been broken for a bit since this project began.\nPitch seemed to be a lottery (though we had not seen it work) and all the rate mod used to do was seemingly speed up the song with no other effect or option being honoured.\nSimilarly, we have moved the ratemod to the first screen of the song options - thanks to the stamina players that popped in to request this, and to mattm for saying that most wanted a speed AND pitch option, which we have called \u0026lsquo;both\u0026rsquo; internally to signify this change.\nThe new layout looks like so:\nWe have fixed the way the off/speed/pitch/speed and pitch options work, so they actually work. This took quite a bit of time to fix the internal pipelines for these, but the end effect is definitely fun. Thanks to Squirrel, Jousway and Jose for bringing this one up the pipeline to get it done for this release!\nTo ensure compatibility with legacy themes, the system \u0026lsquo;defaults\u0026rsquo; to how it was in 5.0.12, with a 0.01x increase, and being on the main menu as folks requested. This is a long overdue Quality of Life update for this, so we\u0026rsquo;re really pleased it\u0026rsquo;s done.\nKNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.9.9 ❕❌ ISSUE gh mode: Some charts have no real \u0026lsquo;standard\u0026rsquo; and will cause a crash when loaded into the game ❕❌ ISSUE techno/popn/gdgf/gddm/gh/para mode: Trying to use the sync audio screen will crash the game - Use dance to sync your game for now ❕❌ ISSUE gddm mode: We do not support the XA codec at this time, it\u0026rsquo;ll play silent. ❕❌ ISSUE beat/popn/gddm some early (pre2013) songs may play some sound samples / keysounds at the wrong speed Full Changelog Follows: ALL: Mode Specific\n❕✅ Fixed DTX Detection of track/lane sizes overflowing the notefield ❕✅ Fixed BMS/DTX/PMS Keysound iterator edge crash ❕✅ New!

Please find your save folder and delete the contents of /cache. This will make your first time run of 4.9.8 slightly longer as it has to rebuild the index, but it is to accomodate the new modes/setup etc. This alpha has tweaked the way the delta clock works, take care to read the information below! If you find that your histogram is slightly skewed one side or the other, like the example below, please take a moment to go into options -\u0026gt; audio offsync and recalibrate your offset. Since 4.9.7GG we have slightly adjusted the renderer pipeline to optimise how we deal with frames within the Kernel Timer of the OS. This is to prepare for new sound/render drivers coming in the near future, but as we\u0026rsquo;ve found with a lot in this game, baby steps to fix little blockers before we do major updates. We also have removed more of the Rage Engine in favour of modern mathematics algorithms, and this has needed a slight tweak to the order on how we draw things.\nThis example above shows the mismatched offset from 4.9.7GG\nUsing the sound offset menu to sync your system, you can get a much tighter response, and this will enable you to chase those fantastics!\nPlease do the sound calibration in dance mode! This may not be available in your custom theme, so do it before you swap over! PLEASE NOTE F2 TO RELOAD SCRIPTS HAS MOVED BACK TO THE F2 KEY!!! (for now as it will be a modders debug menu in the future) New (and some Old!) Modes Update. This (slightly delayed) month\u0026rsquo;s update beings some inner reworkings to the gameplay and modes available to play. We are listing them here for your awareness so you can help test them with us, but they will be officially announced in a future release, so please be aware these new modes ARE NOT COMPLETE, and DO NOT REFLECT the final finished versions for their type, due to the fact most of them have no dedicated theme or style setup as they\u0026rsquo;ve not been touched in 7-15 years. We are going to stop the trend of \u0026lsquo;adding new stuff then doing nothing with it\u0026rsquo; that was so common in the project we are formed from, so that is not going to continue with OutFox. All modes support all the modding systems that dance does, so for those of you that wish to explore, have at it! Most of these modes are sadly neglected and have been without support or a maintainer for upwards of a decade, so be a touch sympathetic to them if you decide to take the time to explore, they will be given the love they deserve.\nFirstly, lets talk about the new modes. These are still a work in progress, but are functional for you to experience.\nIf you wish to autogen charts, you can go to Options -\u0026gt; System Settings -\u0026gt; Project OutFox Settings -\u0026gt; Autogen Steps to ON. Restart your game, and the autogen will make some charts for you to play the new modes. For a better experience, go to the \u0026lsquo;modifiers\u0026rsquo; menu on player options (when you have selected a song, double tap start) and select super shuffle as it will rebalance the notes across the new modes, instead of favouring the left hand side. We will be fixing the auto-generator in a future release, but this works well for now for you to at least have a play.\nThe new keybindings for the modes will be updated shortly on our wiki.\ngddm This is a 9 panel (and 10 panel) drum mode based off of the DTX drum kits and inspired by DrumMania, that supports Midi drums and original controllers. Midi support is only on Windows at this time, but we will have a working driver for all platforms by the end of the summer. Gameplay is played on drums, (or keyboard!) and follows the drum use in a chart.\nThe theming for this mode is incomplete, as is common with a lot of the project at the moment, but again there is enough there to play and experiment with! The editor can be used to create charts, as the new DTX loader for this mode is being built and will be made available in the future. If you have comments or thoughts about this mode, let us know.\ngdgf This mode is based off of the 3 fret/lane guitar mode inspired from Guitarfreaks, however, we have chosen to expand it to include the 5 lane (and a new exclusive 6 lane mode!) for OutFox\u0026rsquo;s inspired mode.\ngdgf uses much tighter timing than the other guitar mode, so take a moment and test yourself if you\u0026rsquo;re feeling brave! This mode will use the new DTX loader when it\u0026rsquo;s complete, but you can also use Autogen or the editor to have a play with some charts in the meantime. Again, we have yet to build a theme for this mode, so please bear with us while we create new stuff for these modes.\ngh This is a 5 lane (and 6 lane coming soon!) mode based off of a collection of popular games that used a guitar styled controller to press frets and strum along to bass and guitar parts of a song. We have added a new .CHART and .MIDI loader, and new note types and internal changes so this mode works without being squished around the old 4K dance engine side.\nThere will be new theme and broken down menu options for this mode in due course, when we introduce a new experience for those who wish to try it.\nWe support Jam Mode where one player can be one play type, and the other can backup or be rhythm. This has the benefit of adding variety into the play, and allows you both to play different parts of the song at the same time. You can do this on several of the styles. One thing to note! You should go into the player options when selecting a song and ensure that you set the modifications to Constant BPM, and set the speed mod to around C450 to emulate the speed from clone hero or similar. At the bottom of this menu, if you go to effects and scroll down towards the bottom, you will also see a new selection of modifiers available exclusively in gh mode: The evaluation and results screens will be reworked in the next version, so ignore the fact it\u0026rsquo;s counting calories and pretending to be dance mode!\npopn This mode has been around for a very long time, but has not really had any support or been looked at since before 2010. It was side-lined into the BMS loader, which actually broke a lot of the needed changes PMS actually uses, and as a result most PMS files with 7 or 9 lanes, would be added to the game as beat 10 lane or 14 lane charts. It was known there were issues with this mode, but we were not aware it was broken as bad as it was.\nSquirrel would like to thank the anonymous japanese player we\u0026rsquo;ll name \u0026ldquo;竹 (Take)\u0026rdquo; girl, for reporting this bug, who wanted to play Nitro\u0026rsquo;s PMS chart of the song on OutFox, but experienced the issue above, and there were also issues with how the keysounds were being loaded for this song in popn mode and she took the time to give a very detailed report in DM on discord, but deleted her account before we could see her username. I thank you a lot for the report, and if you ever read this, please come and say hi in our discord!\nSquirrel took the time to investigate it and it was decided to code a new modernised PMS loader to the game, which now correctly loads PMS songs as they should be. This also removes the oddity and edge crashes when anyone wished to play popn mode on OutFox. This song, \u0026lsquo;竹\u0026rsquo; (Bamboo) charted by Nitro was used as a testbed to debug and ensure it properly works correctly in the game, so we took time to fix it so it would be recognised as a 9 Button PMS file. I\u0026rsquo;d like to thank Nitro for charting this as we would never have had the report which meant we could fix 13 year old bugs on our PMS and BMS loaders, and to 竹 girl for taking the time to bring it to our attention so we could fix this properly and have a restored mode. You can find them at https://twitter.com/NitroX72 - Thanks again Nitro!\nWe also have added 2 new noteskins from our community member Daniel, which really add to the style of the game. We have cat, cat-retro, bun, and bun retro!\n(The theme will be complete for the summer)\nWe have taken some older PMS files from the talented folks at Colorful Channel that also did not parse and work correctly, and these now do show up and play as expected once again.\nAs per the BMS/PMS specification, we also have added for the first time, new #BGA channel 06 (POOR), 07 (BG2) and 0A (LAYER 2) support, and will code these effectively when the theme for this mode is complete. We also support the missing LN# (Long Notes) that have never been in this game before, as well as the #ITEM channels.\nWe will continue to adapt and add the missing functionality from PMS moving forward, now it has it\u0026rsquo;s own loader. This loader now also supports 3 lane (in preparation for battle support), 4 lane for hello pop\u0026rsquo;n (ハロー！ポップンミュージック) and 5/7 lanes for pop\u0026rsquo;n portable (ポップンミュージックポータブル). These have been coded and added to the game, with the 3 lane awaiting new PMS code and subtype item code to be added before it will work. There is also a rumoured 18 lane mode, which I\u0026rsquo;m trying to research. If you know any sources/samples/charts, let Squirrel know!\nbeat Just adding this here to show the \u0026lsquo;miss\u0026rsquo; or #BGA06 POOR layer in action. As is typical, we have no theme\u0026hellip;\nThis needs coding and the proper layout supported, as moving forward we also want to add and support the missing BMS specification as well as add new support via BMSON in the future. It is just part of our pledge to support new and interesting modes moving forwards that we hope folks will enjoy!\ntechno We have added the missing 9panel/18panel support from this mode, as requested by a few folks. There was enough demand to add the extra panel. You can create charts for this on the editor, as we do not believe there are any sims for this yet!\n18 panel example gameplay is here: This mode requires good mobility and that you don\u0026rsquo;t use too much polish as slippery pads can lead to falls!\nA Techno 18 panel in the wild, with a cat token collector!\nChanges to Default Theme Pause Menu This one is important. Due to the need to change the system for the new BGA/Layer system for the BMS/PMS/DTX etc mode support, we have had to adjust the methodology in how the pause menu is drawn by the theme. On the default theme, the hold escape to give up option has been swapped to give an instant display of the menu. Older/OutFox supported themes that are specifically for dance will experience no change here, as we have kept backwards compatibility for them. We will look at re-adding this \u0026lsquo;hold\u0026rsquo; option in the future perhaps if it can be sorted within the new modes.\n** New Feature **\nHold/Roll Tail Type - Lift This function will add a tail note to all holds and lifts, making it so that you have to lift your foot/finger/etc from the end of a hold. This adds a little bit of a challenge for files, and can help with training for foot positions for players that wish to progress to higher chart difficulties. The benefits of removing the foot at the correct time can enable better preparedness for upcoming streams or any technical that the chart may have, which could be lost because of inaccurate foot removal from holds or rolls.\nOn rolls, they have the same behaviour as before, however, the last lift will be done on the \u0026lsquo;beat\u0026rsquo; of that roll. Once more, this trains for better foot stance and movement when a roll ends especially for stamina play. The player will be recorded a normal note \u0026lsquo;miss\u0026rsquo; if the tail lift is not performed at the correct moment.\nThese modifiers are available in all game modes, however, not all noteskins will have the support for them, and some themers will need to add these to their player options menus if they wish to add the availability to their theme.\nKNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.9.8 ❕❌ ISSUE gh mode: Some charts have no real \u0026lsquo;standard\u0026rsquo;

This will set up your board driver, and allow you to use keyboard/XInput/Bluetooth controllers to control the game while you\u0026rsquo;re on your pad. You will need to set UseOldJoystickMapping=0 so the game will initialise the XInput controller driver alongside your Python board.\nThis preference only currently supports the Python23IO driver, but will be expanded to Reflex and other drivers in the future.

We have been spending some of the time in the downtime over the holiday to actually look into this and we discovered that the system was indeed not performing remotely as designed, and has been broken since late 2004. The main bug report was #22 and #59 by @PCBoyGames and well, we discovered that on further investigation, those bugs were caused to a misinterpretation of the way that the random generator was designed and how it should be used in getting/acquiring a random number.\nSuperShuffle/Blender and Soft_Shuffle This was further crushed in it\u0026rsquo;s delivery with shuffle and super shuffle, and anything really that relied on these broken systems. To resolve them we have removed the 1999 era code and modernised it to current modern standards. This has the benefit of completely fixing SuperShuffle (Blender on old versions) and now the distribution is as expected, not to the left.\nThis has the side effect of making the randomness different for each player so bear this in mind if you\u0026rsquo;re going to play! We will add a Mirror function for this so Player 1 = Player 2 in the future.\nPORTAL on the Music Wheel Those of you that use the default theme, we have returned a feature that was oddly missing on 5.3, and that was the Portal slot next to Roulette and Random.\nWhat is Portal? Portal will pick at random from an open folder/group and if you move on it and away from it it will select a different song. If you close your folder so none are open, then portal will pick at random from your whole collection for that mode.\nExtended Mode Most Played should now spawn songs, I sadly have a low level of played songs due to this being a development build, but you can get the general gist of how this system works.\nFolder Courses now spawn a collection as expected, and should be different ONI Mode With the new random modes now working as expected, this has been a welcome quality of life for ONI mode: Artist songs are now shuffled as expected!\nEndless Mode This mode has never been given any love so far from the dev team, so much so even the layout hasn\u0026rsquo;t been finalised! We will look at fixing this and making this mode consistent in the future, so forgive the \u0026lsquo;default\u0026rsquo; looking layout.\nRandom Attacks There were issues with how this methodology was supposed to actually work, as it likely has been broken for so long. Well in this release, we have unique per player random attacks for that extra challenge!

We are super proud of this achievement and you can now move to the M1 macs without worry of your pads not working.\nTo support this new input methods available to Mac M1, we have a fully native build. No more Rosetta!\nWE HAVE SET THE GAME TO USE HIDAPI BY DEFAULT, DUE TO THE LACK OF SUPPORT FOR XINPUT PADS AT THIS TIME. THIS IS AN SDL2 AND APPLE ISSUE, AND IS NOT FIXED IN 11.1.\nWe have full support for pads in HIDAPI, and XInput pads do work when mapped, however, just to keep it simple, use HIDAPI 👍\nOn the Keymap screen, we added new secondary and tertiary inputs, unintentionally mirroring the @taronuke nitg project. Inspired I think. When we were discussing the feature request, two of the developers were unaware that the input menu for NiTG had 5 input rows. However, I will credit our sister project, I don\u0026rsquo;t want folks to think we take inspired options without reporting the origins, we work together to benefit all of our community.\nYou can now map multiple controllers and keys for players, as by request of several community players.\nALL: ❕✅ Fix adjusted FFMPEG libraries to allow for more supported formats ❕✅ New Game Select Screen ❕✅ New Lua game selector ❕✅ Allow user to select game on first run ❕✅ Fix Pump fakes not being referenced ❕✅ Fix theme changing method now Lua is an option ❕✅ Update Lua to 5.3.6 ❕✅ Restore SM OutFox lexicon for backwards compatibility with cmd() based content ❕✅ Restore SM OutFox %d patch for backwards compatibility (Thanks ArcticFqx!) ❕✅ Fix Lua intregral floats to match current behaviour (Thanks Mr.ThatKid!) ❕✅ Fix noteskin switching after first play ❕✅ Update SDL2 ❕✅ Restore OutFox patches to SDL2 for International and Language support ❕✅ Tighten up animation/screen change timings to be quicker ❕✅ Fix drawing of characters with masking backgrounds ❕✅ Added \u0026rsquo;legacy\u0026rsquo; draw mode to match 5.1/5.0 themer expectation (Slower, but use sparingly!) ❕✅ Added Smoothlines Matrix Options for Backwards Compatibility ❕✅ Added new LineStripM to allow for newer options moving forward, so older content is not broken accidentally ❕✅ Added Allow Player to have controllable vanish point \u0026amp; FOV ❕✅ Added function for controlling the vanish point\u0026rsquo;s X \u0026amp; Y separately ❕✅ Added Allow NotePath to use the secondary DrawMode ❕✅ Fixed Array overflow on P3IO, marquee lights should work as designed now ❕✅ Created a separate FOV+VanishPoint for Player ❕✅ Fixed potential crash in FOV in DrawFunctions ❕✅ Changed \u0026lsquo;cement mixer\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;super shuffle\u0026rsquo; in mods (blender in SL) ❕✅ Add new Lua patch for random to work as before in older themes/content ❕✅ Fix errant reference and allow math.random(seed) to operate as designed ❕✅ New Feature: New NoteDataUtil random generator to fix shuffle mods ❕✅ Patch other \u0026ldquo;Random\u0026rdquo; generation to work for now - more work is required ❕✅ Reimplement color variable for noteskins ❕✅ Allow LoadActorForNoteSkin to properly use the new color variable ❕✅ Implement NoteSkin draw order metric ❕✅ Make PeakNPS a 2 decimal value ❕✅ Stop Smoothlines option setting selection restarting the game ❕✅ Change option text for input method in the Experimental Menu to HIDAPI/XInput ❕✅ Added missing font fallbacks Windows 7+:\n❕✅ Fixed LibUSB libraries causing game crash ❕✅ Built new LibUSB dlls to ensure compatibility Windows XP (32bit):\n❕✅ Fixed LibUSB libraries causing game crash Linux:\n❕✅ Fixed lib linking with new FFMPEG version MacOSX (Intel):\n❕✅ Fixed Compile with new SDL version ❕✅ Fixed LibUSB not picking up plugged in xbox controllers MacOSX (M1):\n❕✅ Remove Redundant Darwin (\u0026lt;10.9) calls preventing compile on M1 ❕✅ Allow the arm64 arch to be exposed so XCode can actually see our M1 even in Rosetta Brew mode ❕✅ Allow the OS Functions to be taken into consideration on the compile so we can see USB ❕✅ Fix warnings with XCode in the input handler, and updated the plist to ensure we are current ❕✅ Added new libs for LibUSB ❕✅ Added new libs for FFMPEG ❕✅ Fixed SDL2 compile options so dynamic input works! ❕✅ Fixed PlayStation 1/2/3/4/5 controllers not detecting their buttons on HIDAPI mode ❕✅ Fixed Controllers from Pre-2005 not being detected in HIDAPI mode ❕✅ New Database will need to be added to in the future when SDL is updated for mac.

Japan - © 2004 Sunrise/TV Tokyo)\nThe Alpha of many changes\u0026hellip; Introducing Both At Once! What is Both At Once? Both at once is a popular feature option used in @taronuke\u0026rsquo;s project Not in the Groove. It allows player one to input to player two, while playing mod files. As many of the mod files ported from NitG require two joined players, and before this alpha, the method to enable autoplay for the alternate player was a bit sketchy on SM5, we have taken the time to add this feature to OutFox.\nHow do we use it? Ever accidentally turned on \u0026lsquo;Monkey Input\u0026rsquo; and wondered why the game doesn\u0026rsquo;t work anymore? Well, we removed Monkey Input from the F3 Debug Menu, and in it\u0026rsquo;s place, we have added the BAO option!\nYou need to be in a game menu, and have added 2 players to activate it, (So after you have selected a mode, or on the music wheel) - or you simply will not be able to activate it. This is to protect you having settings or menus operate as both players at once, which could be a pain!\nWhen you are in a game mode, you can add two players and then turn the option on: Press and Hold F3, then press 5\nYou will then be in BAO mode, and can play mod files! (You can find a collection of ported and original files from our community)\n(Screen Select Music - Setting both at once mode on)\nYou can also select menu options and settings in BAO mode for the song, but do bear in mind many mod files set their own speed mods and noteskins:\nYou can then play the game as one player, but it will fill in for two!\nThings to note!\nIf you are player 2, then player 1 will be your \u0026lsquo;ghost\u0026rsquo; and vice versa If there is a mini-game in the mod file, which checks for individual player input, we will not override this with BAO! (This is to mirror NitG Behaviour, and is as designed) The player you are not playing on will be disqualified, and it\u0026rsquo;s score won\u0026rsquo;t be saved, even if it is displayed in the evaluation screen You can turn off and on BAO during a song, using F3 + 5 BAO will be reset when leaving the Select Music Screen, or if the System Switch is pressed On evaluation, you will note player 1 matches player 2:\nWe also have some different pages on the evaluation page - if you press left or right you will change \u0026lsquo;page\u0026rsquo; to reveal more details.\nThe scatter graph in this alpha is drawn a lot more efficiently, which should prevent the slowdown when looking at many presses.\nThe \u0026lsquo;histogram\u0026rsquo; is another highly requested feature for outfox, adapted from the features from https://github.com/Simply-Love/Simply-Love-SM5, we draw it differently in OutFox, as we have the different timing windows.\nNew Actor Multi Vertex Draw options! This alpha also introduces a few new options for controlling your draw commands when creating an actormultivertex(). There were some issues we found in the methodology used in the older code which sometimes allowed the game to fall back to CPU based rendering/calculation for drawing some objects and lines, causing stuttering and arrow lag in screen gameplay, and would cause odd slowdowns in the evaluation screen (as noted by many of our stamina players, when playing marathon mode!)\nWe added two new draw options, and optimised some of the older modes to be less heavy on the game while drawing effects or UI objects.\nNote the VPF (Vertices per Frame) Count. Higher counts mean higher loads on the system: (Before with drawmode_quadstrip) The draw mode has been changed to just use points, dropping the value considerably. (After with the new drawmode_points) Another thing that can be decided in the Lua command is the state of the points, which allow for square or circle points: Square: Circle: New lua commands: self:SetDrawState{Mode=\u0026quot;DrawMode_Points\u0026quot;}:SetVertices(verts)\nNew Draw Modes, we have DrawMode_Points and DrawMode_Lines!\nself:SetPointState(boolean) (so false or true - Alias the Points. if the size is too big, or it is not supported on the GPU\u0026rsquo;s driver, it will be drawn as a square, but won\u0026rsquo;t crash.)\nexample: circle: self:SetPointState(true) square: self:SetPointState(false)\nresizable points: self:SetPointSize(float) - Size in PIXELS of the point to draw. This will often round to a whole number on older systems, but most cards will use subpixel sampling to keep these as designed. For better performance, use a whole number, so 6.0.\nExample: self:SetPointSize(10.5)\nThese are called in your actormultivertex like so:\nlocal amv = Def.ActorMultiVertex { OnCommand=function(self) self:SetDrawState{Mode=\u0026#34;DrawMode_Points\u0026#34;}:SetVertices(verts) self:SetPointSize(10.5) self:SetPointState(1) end } Example drawn with thin DrawMode_Lines: Oh, we built a Windows XP build for those with cabinets.\nTEXTURE FONT GENERATOR V0.33 https://github.com/TeamRizu/Texture-Font-Generator-2020-Squirrel ❕✅🐲📝 Added Hebrew (Thanks Snil4 for the request) ❕✅🐲📝 Set the \u0026rsquo;example\u0026rsquo; glyph to be 0000058 so it is usually displayed by obscure fonts.

Apologies for the Delay on this release. The changelog for 4.8.6 and 4.9.0 are together in this update.\nWe have sorted out the issues with the misunderstanding of the StepMania project name and this will return to the project for the next alpha, with a re-brand. It was all done amicably, and it had to be acted upon due to it being reported, so no problems there.\nFonts and Language: This month sees a pretty big revamp to the font system used in OutFox. Due to the numerous issues we have had reported to us since our project began, (missing symbols, missing characters, missing language support, missing Korean and Japanese support, etc), We have rewritten the font maps.\nWhat this means for you? - Well, the fonts will be sharper as they are newer now, and you can generate the correct fonts for theming and such for OutFox in the future. We have a new repository for the Texture Font Generator which is a side project from @Scraticus and @Hanubeki to bring more charmaps to the game. These can be regenerated to support 5.0/5.1 and even 3.9/ITG era with a bit of work. If you do generate new fonts, please check out the guide that will be up on the MoonDance site shortly. We also have revamped the fonts that are used by mod files to be sharper and to add backwards support for the new fonts. (Beware of [main] duplication causing squares to be displayed by the game!). There is a new release of the Texture Font Generator, which includes new euro support, and legacy mapping generation for prior versions of StepMania.\nTEXTURE FONT GENERATOR V0.2 / OutFox Alpha 4.9.0 - ❕✅🐲📝 Fixed Missing Korean Basic Characters #109 (Thanks AngledLuffa!) ❕✅🐲 Fixed Missing Symbol Characters from Kanji ❕✅🐲 Fixed Missing Characters from Korean Hangul ❕✅🐲 Fixed Missing Characters from Kanji JIS ❕✅🐲 Fixed Missing Characters from Kanji Hojo ❕✅🐲 Fixed Missing Characters from Kanji GBK for Traditional Chinese ❕✅🐲 Fixed Missing Characters from Cyrillic and Extended Latin ❕✅🐲 Regenerated outline fonts for the theme and mods ❕✅🐲 Added Characters from Legacy maps - (ASCII/CP1252/ISO8859) ❕✅🐲 Fixed Build system on windows 10, but the MFC system needs a bit of hacking - compiled binaries are available to grab We have also have had to add a new set of Lua Commands for this alpha. (See #121) We have been aware of this for some time, but delayed the alpha a touch so they were ready. For backwards compatibility string.upper() and string.lower() have not been touched.\nThe new lua commands in this build are ToUpper() and ToLower().\nTo display upper case text - done on the troublesome polish characters: Text=ToUpper(Screen.String(\u0026quot;Start To Join\u0026quot;)) produces:\nWe even can do a proper UTF friendly lower case as well: Text=ToLower(Screen.String(\u0026quot;Start To Join\u0026quot;)) USING ALT+ENTER TO SWITCH IN AND OUT OF FULLSCREEN: We have added the option to all operating systems to be able to access this function, but be warned: the SDL window does not scale modes which your Monitor does not support in fullscreen. It will draw a border around the window if the mode is not a suitable mode. You can find these modes in the log.txt, as SDL is kind enough to display everything supported there.\nWe have allowed the other OS\u0026rsquo;s this function for familiarity and the fact we didn\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;d work on mac/linux, but it did.\nALL:\n❕✅ Set locale for the game to use en_US.UTF-8 for now - This will be extended soon ❕✅ Fix Missing font paths in the default theme ❕✅ Remove Lua macro which did nothing to the font display ❕✅📝 Fixed Bug with BeginnerHelper hiding/unhiding backgrounds causing unwanted behaviour. #104 \u0026amp; #105 (Thanks @SilentTempest83 !) ❕✅📝 Fixed crash with resizing window on some older windows versions (7/8) #102 (Thanks @Emilovesdoubles) ❕✅📝 Fixed Lirocode in Hold / Roll anchors #106 (Thanks @JapanYoshi!) ❕✅📝 Fixed Lirocode in Note colours and 24th\u0026rsquo;s being wrong. #111 \u0026amp; #112 (Thanks @AngledLuffa!) ❕✅📝 Fixed missing Narumi Mascot avatar images not being available as usable avatars in game #115 (Thanks @Joehuu!) ❕✅📝 Added Precision Dance Pad config entry to our GameControllerDB #117 (Thanks @AngledLuffa!) ❕✅ Fixed Timing windows for ITG/ITG Advanced and ECFA ❕✅ Fixed Alt+Enter leaving weird screen blackness on 75% of the space ❕✅ Fixed lua timing tables and optimised the loading method ❕✅📝 Fixed bug with toasties loading on the Machine Sync causing an AV (Thanks @JapanYoshi!) ❕✅📝 Fixed bug with left over commands being available to the Machine Sync system causing edge crashes (Thanks @JapanYoshi!) ❕✅📝 Fixed issue with missing UTF string conversion on the loading window (Thanks @Hanubeki / @JapanYoshi!) ❕✅📝 Added correct font (Code2000) support in loading window (Thanks @Hanubeki / @JapanYoshi!) ❕✅ Added preview to progress bar on screenselectmusic ❕✅ Fixed audio preview on song select #65 (Thanks @SHRMP0!) ❕✅ Fixed font presentation for soundwaves and default/fallback ❕✅ Fixed missing/incorrect font redirection files ❕✅ Fixed missing constructors on ActorFrameTexture ❕✅🐲 Beginning of making SM Locale Aware ❕✅🐲 Fix overflow on font index now we are using proper UTF-8 ❕✅🐲 Fix archaic practice on wide strings in font manager ❕✅🐲 Fix arithmetic overflow in rageutil preventing correct bytecode allocation ❕✅ Fix table indexing for high score entries overwriting previous results being shown ❕✅ Rename the 5.3 default noteskin to reinstate the 5.0 default for backwards compatibility support ❕✅ Make minimenu rows place on native position Windows:\n❕✅🐲📝 Removed potential crash on invalid DPI scaling detection - part of #88 (Thanks AngledLuffa!) ❕✅🐲 Fixed Alt+Enter not being able to leave full-screen causing the need for a restart ❕✅ Fixed uninstaller missing shortcuts due to windows 1903 update Linux:\n❕✅🐲 Fixed Alt+Enter not being able to leave full-screen MacOSX:\n❕✅🐲 NEW FEATURE: Added Alt-Enter full-screen switch ❕✅🐲 Fixed missing locale selection for \u0026ldquo;LC_ALL\u0026rdquo; causing a crash ARM/ARM64: (Raspberry Pi etc)\n❕✅🐲 NEW FEATURE: Added Alt-Enter full-screen switch ❕✅🐲 Fixed EGL initialisation on RPi 3B/4 trying to call the wrong driver ❕✅🐲 Fixed missing locale selection for \u0026ldquo;LC_ALL\u0026rdquo; causing a crash Community Content: Colours\n✅ Dark Mode by infinitephantasm ✅ Chaos by moruzerinho6 ✅ Ice by PCBoyGames ✅ Wave by AppleArcade120 Translations\n✅ Translations updated from Moru, SHRMP0 and SheepyChris (Brazilian Portuguese) ✅ Translations updated from MoNeko (Polish) ✅ Translations updated from Hanubeki (Japanese) ✅ Translations updated from Jose_Varela (Spanish) ✅ Translations updated from Daniel Rotwind (German) ✅ Translations updated from Ksempac (French) (The \u0026lsquo;source\u0026rsquo; code below is the reporting issues template, it is not the source for OutFox)\n","description":"Release Date: 7th October 2020 \u0026ldquo;The new Glyph System pleases Imhotep\u0026rdquo; (The Mummy - © 1999 Universal Pictures)\nTurn smoothlines off to get a better play experience if your lines are being drawn thickly!

Due to windows updates, (and Ubuntu updates) that have directly affected several of our users, we have taken the time to bring forward our plans to fix this sooner rather that later.\nWhat this means to you, our players. You now have a choice of using the XInput which will be enabled by default, (and has been the norm since alpha 4.5) which gives the familiar buttons on the XBox controller. We have added a new controller option row in the \u0026lsquo;Experimental Settings\u0026rsquo; which will allow easy change, you will need to reboot your game to reinitialise the input system, but we will make this a non-game reset option in a future update. There is also a preference you can edit which is called UseOldJoystickMapping setting this to 0 sets the XInput mode, and setting this to 1 enables the legacy (HIDAPI) mode for your controller or pad.\nYou will likely need to check your offset for this update, if you are swapping modes, as some controllers behave slightly different in legacy/XInput. This is true especially of custom Arduino pads, so take time to remember to test this.\nIf you use older controllers, please ensure they are plugged in BEFORE you start the game. Because we do not depend on DirectX anymore, we need to initialise the system on game start. We are looking into this, but once the system is live, controllers can be added and removed as normal. We really do not want to go back to DInput7 or DInput8 as Microsoft is really punishing use of these system and will remove them outright eventually.\nKeyboard players can use either method, this update fixed a couple of awry driver update issues on steelseries/Corsair keyboards to fix their polling issue, so you can play as normal.\nIf you have an SMX 4k/5k/pump pad, you can use either mode, but some players have mentioned that legacy \u0026lsquo;feels tighter\u0026rsquo; than XInput for this pad. Give it a try and let us know your thoughts.\nThis new mode allows for more than 4 controllers (which XInput is limited to by design), and does not require a mapping for the gamecontrollerdb.txt file which XInput pads require. This new mode allows the older Joystick path to run, which is based on HIDAPI, thus giving us a greater level of controller support than ever before. If your controller does not show up in OutFox, or has become troublesome since the operating system updates, this is the mode for you. If you have any issues with the new system (bear in mind, you WILL need to go to Key mapping and map all the buttons for your controller to their actions. YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE CONTROLLER MAPPING WITH THIS MODE!\nThe legacy mode returns to a slightly more familiar system from 5.1/5.0 so those of you with particularly troublesome controllers will no longer have issues. The ParaParaParadise Controller prefers to be on legacy. So if you use OutFox for Para/ParaStar/EKS-D remember to set this in your game, and restart. The PPP Controller needs to be plugged in BEFORE you start the game, due to how windows operates now. This is true for Ubuntu also. Mac OSX now also properly supports this controller.\nOn the subject of ParaPara Paradise, this month has seen a lot of work and collaboration to finally fix some of the glaring issues for this mode. We will continue to do this for all our modes, so look out for updates!\nParaPara Paradise mode has been given a swathe of fixes: ❕✅ Fixed Noteskin loading on PPP mode ❕✅ Fixed missing theme elements on PPP mode ❕✅ Added new timing windows for PPP mode, which match the PS2/2nd Mix games ❕✅ Added new judgement names for PPP mode to match PS2/2nd Mix ❕✅ Added new Tick hit support - This allows for a hit if the sensor is triggered, as per the original games ❕✅ Added new Hold Tick Hit support - Fixes a long overdue bug in holds on PPP mode. ❕✅ Added new column style \u0026lsquo;active\u0026rsquo; when a sensor is triggered, to closer match the original games ❕✅ Added 2 player support for PPP mode ❕✅ Fixed PPP controller buttons not being recognised in game ❕✅ Added new default noteskin for PPP mode ❕✅ Added new Jara noteskin for PPP mode ❕✅ Fixed evaluation screen elements causing an edge case crash ❕✅ Fixed how the game records play details to be more accurate to the original play experience. ❕✅ Fixed Rate mode being set to a weird value ❕✅ Fixed Speed Mod. For accurate arcade experience, use A or C mod, between 100-300, we feel the sweet spot is 100-150 ❕✅ Fixed missing gameplay elements We hope you all enjoy the new revamped Para Mode, and remember it\u0026rsquo;s also playable on MacOS fully for the first time! If you have any feedback or questions please do not hesitate to contact us on the discord!\nNew Loading Window ❕✅🐲 New loading song error checking - The log will tell you about bad songs ❕✅🐲 New loading window system ❕✅🐲 Support UTF-8 on new loading window ❕✅🐲 New themeable loading window ❕✅🐲 Custom Font loading support ❕✅🐲 New font rendering This version sees the launch of a new loading window, which has plagued the game since 2007. We plan to use this new window for more features in the future, and it will become fully themeable for those of you that wish to modify it. It is cross platform so replaces the legacy Linux Loader, and the horribly bugged MacOSX loader. The other good thing about this mode is when you load songs, it will check your audio files for availability. What this means, if the file is corrupted or damaged, or just unable to be loaded by the game, you will get a notice in your log file. For ease of viewing, you can scan the games songs with the new version, then check out info.txt in your /logs folder. if you have any damaged songs or corrupt mp3s etc, they will be logged here. An example from my own simfile collection:\nWARNING: Sound file /AdditionalSongs/parapara/Big O/Big O.ogg couldn't be opened: . Please check it is not corrupted and redownload the file.\nWe hope you find this a welcome addition, as it will prevent some sudden crashing or silence being played in the song wheel. This feature will be worked on in the future, so if you have any ideas please throw them our way! Sometimes the window will look like it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026rsquo;locked up\u0026rsquo; on Windows - this is just the SSC cache being generated! Give it a moment and it\u0026rsquo;ll sort itself out, it only does it once.\nWe have plans to allow the online patcher and for configurations to be changed/set up for the future, so I\u0026rsquo;m hoping it is stable for you all and works as designed.\nNew MP3 Driver: ❕✅ Removed libMAD and it\u0026rsquo;s dependencies ❕✅ Added new dr_mp3 MP3 Driver (clean for closed source phase) ❕✅ Added new libmpeg123 MP3 Driver (not in repo but available for open source phase) ❕✅🐲 Fixed internal Threads overflow ❕✅🐲 Fixed internal buffer sizes ❕✅🐲 Set modern system settings to allow transition This has been in the background for some time. LibMAD has been a bit of a thorn in our side for some years, and as it is also GPL, it does not really fit with our closed source phase, so we have spent the past 3 months working on a resolution. We have two drivers, Libmpeg123, and dr_mp3. Libmpeg123 will be added when we are open source, and currently is on a closed branch not for distribution. dr_mp3 is the new library we have chosen to fully support as it finally adds VBR support, it\u0026rsquo;s lightweight, and also finally stops one of the broken_pipe problems on the Raspberry Pi 2/3 boards. It also has meant we have taken the time to identify more problems with the sound delivery in the game, so we will be fixing these in the future. For now we have tweaked the pipe to be consistent across drivers, so this also has given us a better experience across the different modes. We also will be looking at a new asynchronous loading mode for Keysounds, primarily for beat/popn so the load times will be reduced and this will deliver a better player experience.\nIf you experience any issues with the new sound driver, do let us know, but it has had some serious testing so we\u0026rsquo;re hoping it is stable and sane for you guys!\nThe other fixes for this month include:\nALL:\n❕✅🐲 Fix texture buffer inconsistencies in RageTextureManager ❕✅🐲 Fixed resolution of some broken actorframe calls ❕✅ Fixed several pointer dereferences in actor handling ❕✅ Fixed a few missing casts in the GL pipe ❕✅ Fixed missing oem102 key for foreign keyboards ❕✅ Fixed bad issues with variables in RageSurface ❕✅ Revert C++ opts until the new compile method is finished ❕✅ Fixed absf math issues when calculating locations ❕✅ Fix compiler unoptimised functions causing slowdown on tweens ❕✅ Prevent overlapped centering when - 1p occurs (Thanks Neko²) ❕✅ Fix sizing on - 6/8 panel modes ❕✅ Fix size of notefield via AR over ScreenWidth ❕✅ Allow HoldJudgements to receive Player variables ❕✅ Change round method on stats display ❕✅ Support for toggling audio preview modes for ScreenSelectMusic ❕✅🐲 Changed the use of ragefile within sound engine ❕✅🐲 Removed GL 4.6 and 3.3 due to windows 10 update bugs killing the intel driver ❕✅📝 Fixed Esc not leaving test input screen Issue #41 (Thanks Moru!) ❕✅📝 Allowed early dismissal of input keybind warning Issue 40 ❕✅📝 Fixed non-random Seed generation for game/stage Issue 38 (Thanks JustinLove) ❕✅📝 Fixed Game Crash in Extended/Course Mode Issue 29 (Thanks Jubo) ❕✅📝 Fixed FPS Slowdown on some GPUs Issue 25 (Thanks LightningSkunk) ❕✅📝 Fixed Notefield Overlaps on Center 1 player Issue 24 (Thanks SilentTempest83/Neko²) ❕✅📝 Fixed Random noteskins failing to activate Issue 21 (Thanks bibusdax) ❕✅📝 Make ScreenTextEntry handle caps lock once more Issue #13(Thanks Moru!)

We really do not want to go back to DInput7 or DInput8 as Microsoft is really punishing use of these system and will remove them outright eventually.\nKeyboard players can use either method, this update fixed a couple of awry driver update issues on steelseries/Corsair keyboards to fix their polling issue, so you can play as normal.\nIf you have an SMX 4k/5k/pump pad, you can use either mode, but some players have mentioned that legacy \u0026lsquo;feels tighter\u0026rsquo; than XInput for this pad. Give it a try and let us know your thoughts.\nThis new mode allows for more than 4 controllers (which XInput is limited to by design), and does not require a mapping for the gamecontrollerdb.txt file which XInput pads require. This new mode allows the older Joystick path to run, which is based on HIDAPI, thus giving us a greater level of controller support than ever before. If your controller does not show up in OutFox, or has become troublesome since the operating system updates, this is the mode for you. If you have any issues with the new system (bear in mind, you WILL need to go to Key mapping and map all the buttons for your controller to their actions. YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE CONTROLLER MAPPING WITH THIS MODE!\nThe legacy mode returns to a slightly more familiar system from 5.1/5.0 so those of you with particularly troublesome controllers will no longer have issues. The ParaParaParadise Controller prefers to be on legacy. So if you use OutFox for Para/ParaStar/EKS-D remember to set this in your game, and restart. The PPP Controller needs to be plugged in BEFORE you start the game, due to how windows operates now. This is true for Ubuntu also. Mac OSX now also properly supports this controller.\nOn the subject of ParaPara Paradise, this month has seen a lot of work and collaboration to finally fix some of the glaring issues for this mode. We will continue to do this for all our modes, so look out for updates!\nParaPara Paradise mode has been given a swathe of fixes: ❕✅ Fixed Noteskin loading on PPP mode ❕✅ Fixed missing theme elements on PPP mode ❕✅ Added new timing windows for PPP mode, which match the PS2/2nd Mix games ❕✅ Added new judgement names for PPP mode to match PS2/2nd Mix ❕✅ Added new Tick hit support - This allows for a hit if the sensor is triggered, as per the original games ❕✅ Added new Hold Tick Hit support - Fixes a long overdue bug in holds on PPP mode. ❕✅ Added new column style \u0026lsquo;active\u0026rsquo; when a sensor is triggered, to closer match the original games ❕✅ Added 2 player support for PPP mode ❕✅ Fixed PPP controller buttons not being recognised in game ❕✅ Added new default noteskin for PPP mode ❕✅ Added new Jara noteskin for PPP mode ❕✅ Fixed evaluation screen elements causing an edge case crash ❕✅ Fixed how the game records play details to be more accurate to the original play experience. ❕✅ Fixed Rate mode being set to a weird value ❕✅ Fixed Speed Mod. For accurate arcade experience, use A or C mod, between 100-300, we feel the sweet spot is 100-150 ❕✅ Fixed missing gameplay elements We hope you all enjoy the new revamped Para Mode, and remember it\u0026rsquo;s also playable on MacOS fully for the first time! If you have any feedback or questions please do not hesitate to contact us on the discord!\nNew Loading Window ❕✅🐲 New loading song error checking - The log will tell you about bad songs ❕✅🐲 New loading window system ❕✅🐲 Support UTF-8 on new loading window ❕✅🐲 New themeable loading window ❕✅🐲 Custom Font loading support ❕✅🐲 New font rendering This version sees the launch of a new loading window, which has plagued the game since 2007. We plan to use this new window for more features in the future, and it will become fully themeable for those of you that wish to modify it. It is cross platform so replaces the legacy Linux Loader, and the horribly bugged MacOSX loader. The other good thing about this mode is when you load songs, it will check your audio files for availability. What this means, if the file is corrupted or damaged, or just unable to be loaded by the game, you will get a notice in your log file. For ease of viewing, you can scan the games songs with the new version, then check out info.txt in your /logs folder. if you have any damaged songs or corrupt mp3s etc, they will be logged here. An example from my own simfile collection:\nWARNING: Sound file /AdditionalSongs/parapara/Big O/Big O.ogg couldn't be opened: . Please check it is not corrupted and redownload the file.\nWe hope you find this a welcome addition, as it will prevent some sudden crashing or silence being played in the song wheel. This feature will be worked on in the future, so if you have any ideas please throw them our way! Sometimes the window will look like it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026rsquo;locked up\u0026rsquo; on Windows - this is just the SSC cache being generated! Give it a moment and it\u0026rsquo;ll sort itself out, it only does it once.\nWe have plans to allow the online patcher and for configurations to be changed/set up for the future, so I\u0026rsquo;m hoping it is stable for you all and works as designed.\nNew MP3 Driver: ❕✅ Removed libMAD and it\u0026rsquo;s dependencies ❕✅ Added new dr_mp3 MP3 Driver (clean for closed source phase) ❕✅ Added new libmpeg123 MP3 Driver (not in repo but available for open source phase) ❕✅🐲 Fixed internal Threads overflow ❕✅🐲 Fixed internal buffer sizes ❕✅🐲 Set modern system settings to allow transition This has been in the background for some time. LibMAD has been a bit of a thorn in our side for some years, and as it is also GPL, it does not really fit with our closed source phase, so we have spent the past 3 months working on a resolution. We have two drivers, Libmpeg123, and dr_mp3. Libmpeg123 will be added when we are open source, and currently is on a closed branch not for distribution. dr_mp3 is the new library we have chosen to fully support as it finally adds VBR support, it\u0026rsquo;s lightweight, and also finally stops one of the broken_pipe problems on the Raspberry Pi 2/3 boards. It also has meant we have taken the time to identify more problems with the sound delivery in the game, so we will be fixing these in the future. For now we have tweaked the pipe to be consistent across drivers, so this also has given us a better experience across the different modes. We also will be looking at a new asynchronous loading mode for Keysounds, primarily for beat/popn so the load times will be reduced and this will deliver a better player experience.\nIf you experience any issues with the new sound driver, do let us know, but it has had some serious testing so we\u0026rsquo;re hoping it is stable and sane for you guys!\nThe other fixes for this month include:\nALL:\n❕✅🐲 Fix texture buffer inconsistencies in RageTextureManager ❕✅🐲 Fixed resolution of some broken actorframe calls ❕✅ Fixed several pointer dereferences in actor handling ❕✅ Fixed a few missing casts in the GL pipe ❕✅ Fixed missing oem102 key for foreign keyboards ❕✅ Fixed bad issues with variables in RageSurface ❕✅ Revert C++ opts until the new compile method is finished ❕✅ Fixed absf math issues when calculating locations ❕✅ Fix compiler unoptimised functions causing slowdown on tweens ❕✅ Prevent overlapped centering when - 1p occurs (Thanks Neko²) ❕✅ Fix sizing on - 6/8 panel modes ❕✅ Fix size of notefield via AR over ScreenWidth ❕✅ Allow HoldJudgements to receive Player variables ❕✅ Change round method on stats display ❕✅ Support for toggling audio preview modes for ScreenSelectMusic ❕✅🐲 Changed the use of ragefile within sound engine ❕✅🐲 Removed GL 4.6 and 3.3 due to windows 10 update bugs killing the intel driver ❕✅📝 Fixed Esc not leaving test input screen Issue #41 (Thanks Moru!) ❕✅📝 Allowed early dismissal of input keybind warning Issue 40 ❕✅📝 Fixed non-random Seed generation for game/stage Issue 38 (Thanks JustinLove) ❕✅📝 Fixed Game Crash in Extended/Course Mode Issue 29 (Thanks Jubo) ❕✅📝 Fixed FPS Slowdown on some GPUs Issue 25 (Thanks LightningSkunk) ❕✅📝 Fixed Notefield Overlaps on Center 1 player Issue 24 (Thanks SilentTempest83/Neko²) ❕✅📝 Fixed Random noteskins failing to activate Issue 21 (Thanks bibusdax) ❕✅📝 Make ScreenTextEntry handle caps lock once more Issue #13(Thanks Moru!)

Due to windows updates, (and Ubuntu updates) that have directly affected several of our users, we have taken the time to bring forward our plans to fix this sooner rather that later.\nWhat this means to you, our players. You now have a choice of using the XInput which will be enabled by default, (and has been the norm since alpha 4.5) which gives the familiar buttons on the XBox controller. We have added a new controller option row in the \u0026lsquo;Experimental Settings\u0026rsquo; which will allow easy change, you will need to reboot your game to reinitialise the input system, but we will make this a non-game reset option in a future update. There is also a preference you can edit which is called UseOldJoystickMapping setting this to 0 sets the XInput mode, and setting this to 1 enables the legacy (HIDAPI) mode for your controller or pad.\nYou will likely need to check your offset for this update, if you are swapping modes, as some controllers behave slightly different in legacy/XInput. This is true especially of custom Arduino pads, so take time to remember to test this.\nIf you use older controllers, please ensure they are plugged in BEFORE you start the game. Because we do not depend on DirectX anymore, we need to initialise the system on game start. We are looking into this, but once the system is live, controllers can be added and removed as normal.

Some modifiers can be selected through the options menu before starting a song, but there are also simfiles with scripted modifiers that tend to have a wildly different experience than just a regular simfile. (Generally, they\u0026rsquo;re known as \u0026ldquo;modfiles\u0026rdquo;)\nGeneral notes Often, modifiers (or \u0026ldquo;mods\u0026rdquo;) have what\u0026rsquo;s called an \u0026ldquo;approach rate\u0026rdquo;, which is how fast it\u0026rsquo;ll go to reach the specified value. When not specified, an approach rate of 1 is used, which means 100% per second.\nSo, if you have a modifier that goes from 0 to 200%, it will take 2 seconds, while 200% to -150% would take 3.5 seconds. The approach rate can be a floating point number, so values like 0.24523 or 3.7 are valid.\nApproach rates cannot be negative in OutFox alpha 4.8.2 or earlier, or it will crash.\nIn \u0026ldquo;NotITG\u0026rdquo; \u0026amp; OutFox alpha 4.8.3 and later, negative approach rates (specifically -1 in NotITG, but in general on SM5) are used to signify \u0026ldquo;instant\u0026rdquo; rates. in older versions of SM5, you can use large approach rate numbers (such as 10000 or 9e9) to achieve this.\nMagnitude is usually shown in the form of percentages for modifiers, and are capable of being negative, unless otherwise noted.\nThere are also column-specific modifiers. This affect a single column instead of the whole notefield. In NotITG, column numbering starts at 0, while it starts at 1 in SM5.\nFor the column-specific lua functions (except for gradients, mentioned later), nil can be given as the column to affect all columns of a player. (Does not work in alpha 4.8.2 of OutFox or earlier)\nModstrings Normally these modifiers will have a modstring form that follows this general format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;percentage\u0026gt;% \u0026lt;mod name\u0026gt; but some modifiers, like speed mods, may not follow that format.\nWhen not given a percentage, 100% is assumed. no is another way to say 0% as well.\neg: *2 bumpy is the same as *2 100% bumpy.\nThe % is optional and modstrings can work without it, but it\u0026rsquo;s there for visual convenience.\neg: *2 200 bumpy is the same as *2 200% bumpy.\nThe mod name is case insensitive.\nThese modstrings can be used either by simfile ATTACKS, course MODS, or through PlayerOptions\u0026rsquo; FromString function. Smaller numbers like 0.5 require the preceding 0.\nAny modifier or sub modifier that is boolean has a turning point of 50%. Giving 50% or more will turn it on, while 49% or lower will turn it off.\nPlayerOptions Functions Going from modstrings to PlayerOptions functions, the magnitude has to be divided by 100 most of the time, and mod names are now case sensitive.\nWhen calling a PlayerOptions function, they often have an optional final boolean parameter that can be placed after all of the parameters that allows for function chaining similar to what Actor does, allowing for something like this:\nXMod(2.5, 3, true):Drunk(-0.75, 2.7)\nWhen passed nothing in the parameters, the function returns two values: the current magnitude, the current approach rate. However, when passed in parameters, the previous values for magnitude and rate are returned.\nYou can grab a player\u0026rsquo;s PlayerOptions for scripting purposes by doing the following:\nlocal po = {GAMESTATE:GetPlayerState(\u0026#39;PlayerNumber_P1\u0026#39;):GetPlayerOptions(\u0026#39;ModsLevel_Song\u0026#39;),GAMESTATE:GetPlayerState(\u0026#39;PlayerNumber_P2\u0026#39;):GetPlayerOptions(\u0026#39;ModsLevel_Song\u0026#39;)} This stores them into a table for easy access at any point during the song. po[1] is what you\u0026rsquo;d use to affect Player 1, while po[2] affects Player 2. Both will need to be used to affect both players with the same mods.\nSimfile ATTACKS and course MODS will override \u0026amp; reset anything set through lua on the Song level, and cannot be player-specific.\nVideo Examples The video examples for the modifiers use an excerpt of GPOP\u0026rsquo;s expert chart for \u0026ldquo;My Story\u0026rdquo; from the \u0026ldquo;G.P.O.P.S. 3\u0026rdquo; pack.\nThe speed mod used is 1.5x, and the noteskin usually is the default noteskin for dance mode, with Exact3D used when needed.\nThe magnitude used in the video examples also may not be the value used in the textual example.\n","description":"Modifiers Modifiers often change or affect some aspect of the gameplay, usually by messing with the game\u0026rsquo;s notefield.

Larger multiplier numbers result in a faster scroll. This speed mod type is capable of showing BPM changes, stops and other chart segment types. Often ranges of 1 to 4 (and in between at practically any specified granularity) can be common.\nQuirks: When setting this through the lua function it will immediately override CMod, MMod or AMod unlike how it functions in courses or modstring-based modfiles.\nPlayerOptions format: XMod(\u0026lt;multiplier\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: XMod(2.5, 0.5)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;multiplier\u0026gt;x\nExample: *0.5 2.5x\nCMod Desc: The \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo; in \u0026ldquo;CMod\u0026rdquo; is for \u0026ldquo;Constant BPM Scroll\u0026rdquo;, with it often showing as C200 or C450.5 or some other BPM value preceded by a C. Larger BPM values result in faster scroll speeds. This speed mod type visibly ignores chart segments and only shows a constant speed. (some forks of SM even disqualify if the chart has BPM changes and CMod is used!) Other modifiers still work on CMod, though.\nOften ranges of 200 to 400 (and in between at practically any specified granularity) can be common, but some people may be more comfortable reading at slower or faster speeds.\nQuirks: When setting this through the lua function it will immediately override XMod, MMod or AMod unlike how it functions in courses or modstring-based modfiles.\nPlayerOptions format: CMod(\u0026lt;BPM Value\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: CMod(200, 0.5)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; c\u0026lt;BPM value\u0026gt;\nExample: *0.5 c200\nMMod Desc: The \u0026ldquo;M\u0026rdquo; in \u0026ldquo;MMod\u0026rdquo; is for \u0026ldquo;Maximum BPM Scroll\u0026rdquo;, with it often showing as m200 or m450.5 or some other BPM value preceded by an m. Unlike CMod, this speed modifier supports everything that XMod does. Instead of specifying a BPM speed for the whole song, this specifies the maximum scroll speed that will be used.\nOften ranges of 200 to 400 (and in between at practically any specified granularity) can be common, but some people may be more comfortable reading at slower or faster speeds.\nQuirks: The magnitude is in the hundreds most of the time, so a larger approach rate might be needed.\nPlayerOptions format: MMod(\u0026lt;BPM Value\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: MMod(200, 0.5)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; m\u0026lt;BPM value\u0026gt;\nExample: *0.5 m200\nAMod Desc: The \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; in \u0026ldquo;AMod\u0026rdquo; is for \u0026ldquo;Average BPM Scroll\u0026rdquo;, with it often showing as a200 or a450.5 or some other BPM value preceded by an a. Like MMod, this modifier supports everything XMod supports, and the song\u0026rsquo;s BPM is used in calculations, the average of the song\u0026rsquo;s BPMs is calculated instead of the maximum BPM being used. (and the amount of time a BPM lasts for is taken into account, too)\nOften ranges of 200 to 400 (and in between at practically any specified granularity) can be common, but some people may be more comfortable reading at slower or faster speeds.\nQuirks: The magnitude is in the hundreds most of the time, so a larger approach rate might be needed.\nPlayerOptions format: AMod(\u0026lt;BPM Value\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: AMod(200, 0.5)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; a\u0026lt;BPM value\u0026gt;\nExample: *0.5 a200\nRandomSpeed Desc: Each note is given a random addition to its\u0026rsquo; speed mod, with larger additions being applied when a higher magnitude is used. This does not have column-specific controls.\nNormally, 100 is the magnitude used (as it\u0026rsquo;s not commonly used in modfiles), but other values are valid.\nQuirks: Only values greater than zero have any visual effect. Missed notes revert to the actual speed mod upon passing the receptors.\nPlayerOptions format: RandomSpeed(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: RandomSpeed(1, 0.125)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; randomspeed\nExample: *0.125 100% randomspeed\nSpeed Modifier Controllers These modifiers control the internal parts of the speed modifiers above, and usually shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be used unless there\u0026rsquo;s a good reason to. Like the speed mods above, these aren\u0026rsquo;t column-specific either, but can support negative numbers like how the modstrings do. Unlike the speed modifiers listed above, there is no modstring form for any of these.\nTimeSpacing Desc: Allows one to switch between CMod and the remaining mods. At 100%, this tells the game to use CMods. 0% means use XMod/MMod/AMod.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s tweenable like other modifiers, which allows one to tween \u0026lsquo;between\u0026rsquo; CMods and the other mods.\nOften the values used only range between 0 and 100%\nQuirks: The \u0026rsquo;tweening\u0026rsquo; capability can cause interesting stutter effects while tweening. Some modfiles take advantage of this. This cannot be replicated with the plain CMod \u0026amp; XMod PlayerOptions functions, but can be replicated with modstrings.\nPlayerOptions format: TimeSpacing(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: TimeSpacing(1)\nScrollBPM (Used for CMod, values are BPMs) Desc: This is the underlying BPM value that CMod uses. Common values are the same as those for CMod.\nQuirks: Like the BPM-based speed mods, the magnitude is often in the 100s, so a larger approach rate might be needed.\nPlayerOptions format: ScrollBPM(\u0026lt;BPM value\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: ScrollBPM(1, 2)\nAvarageScrollBPM Desc: This is the underlying BPM value that AMod uses. When this is zero, AMod is turned off.

This can allow for column swaps that can\u0026rsquo;t be achieved through just Flip and Invert, but can take more time to set up.\nQuirks: Since alpha 4.8.3, all columns can\u0026rsquo;t be hit from the modstring (possible in NotITG), but can be done through the lua function. Right now (as of Project OutFox alpha 4.7), Pump mode\u0026rsquo;s column-spacing is 48 pixels instead of 64, so use multiples of 0.75 instead when working with Pump mode.

This is often used to change from upscroll to downscroll among other effects.\nReverse Desc: Reverse flips the scroll of the whole notefield from upscroll to downscroll. There is also a column-specific version that adds onto the value of normal Reverse.\nCommonly, 50% or 100% is used on its\u0026rsquo; own.\nQuirks: When going over 100%, the effect goes backwards, with 200% being normal upscroll again. Negative values go upward resulting in a longer notefield. This applies to the column-specific version, too. Going to 100% on column 1 will also make the judgment \u0026amp; combo swap positions.\nFor example, 100% reverse + 100% reverse on a single column would result in that single column having upscroll and the rest being downscroll.\nAvailable Variants (modstring): reverse, reverse\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;\nPlayerOptions format: Reverse(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: Reverse(1, 2)\nColumn-specific format: ReverseCol(\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: ReverseCol(2, 0.25, 0.25)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modstring variant\u0026gt;\nexample: *2 100% reverse *0.25 25% reverse2\nReverse video example\nAvailable sub modifiers: UnboundedReverse Desc: UnboundedReverse is a boolean modifier that makes it so Reverse no longer bounces back when going over 100% (Acts similar to negative reverse, behavior-wise). This affects all reverse-type modifiers, including Split, Alternate and Cross. In NotITG, this is known as reversetype.\nPlayerOptions format: UnboundedReverse(\u0026lt;enable\u0026gt;)\nmodstring format: \u0026lt;enable\u0026gt; unboundedreverse\nSplit Desc: The second half of the notefield gets reversed.\nCommonly, 50% or 100% is used on its\u0026rsquo; own.\nQuirks: Same as Reverse. If used in modes with an odd number of columns, the middle column also gets affected.\nPlayerOptions format: Split(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: Split(0.75,3)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; split\nexample: *3 75% reverse\nSplit video example\nAlternate Desc: Every other column gets reversed, starting with the second column.

Commonly used to create \u0026ldquo;driven drops\u0026rdquo;. Can also be activated with converge in modstring form.\nAlso often combined with other scroll modifiers above.\nCommonly used at 100%, but more or less can be used. Negative values move the notefield up.\nQuirks: The speed it has when going to the center depends on multiple theme metrics, so \u0026ldquo;driven drop\u0026rdquo; effects may be inconsistent across multiple themes. Most modfiles expect ITG positioning, which is available as the \u0026ldquo;Lower\u0026rdquo; note position setting in the default theme. The player\u0026rsquo;s Combo also moves down based on the current amount of Centered.\nPlayerOptions format: Centered(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: Centered(1. 0.5)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; centered\nexample: *0.5 100% centered\nCentered video example\nCenteredPath Desc: While Centered moves the notefield down in position, CenteredPath moves the columns down their current path in multiples of the column\u0026rsquo;s width (Commonly 64 pixels for dance mode). This consist amount allows for more consistent \u0026ldquo;driven drops\u0026rdquo; across different setups. In NotITG, this modifier is called centered2.\nLarge amounts of CenteredPath may be used because \u0026ldquo;driven drops\u0026rdquo; can span the whole screen height.\nWhen combined with the opposite amount of MoveY in upscroll, interesting movement effects can be achieved.\nQuirks: Because CenteredPath moves columns down the path, receptors may become affected by mods that otherwise would not affect them (As seen in the video example with Tornado), and note paths may look different.\nPlayerOptions format: CenteredPath(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: CenteredPath(2.5,0.23)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; centeredpath\nexample: *0.23 250% centeredpath\nCenteredPath video example\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;Driven Drop\u0026rdquo;? Driven Drops are an effect where the notes are stationary while the receptor moves down to hit the notes. (As seen in the ITG course, \u0026ldquo;Driven\u0026rdquo;)\nOften, speed mod has to be taken into account for these (which can be made simpler by forcing a speed mod).\nCenteredPath makes it easier due to using a consistent amount that doesn\u0026rsquo;t depend on multiple theme metrics, but the resulting effect may look different.\n\u0026ldquo;SCAR\u0026rdquo; Gimmicks Before column-specific Reverse existed, Combinations of Split, Cross, Alternate and Reverse (SCAR, for short) were used to generate column-specific reverse in 4 panel modes.

The range between fully lit and fully hidden scales based on the current value of the BGBrightness preference.\nUse negative amounts to bring back the background if BGBrightness is less than 1. A lot of modfiles use large amounts of negative cover to deal with any positive value BGBrightness could have.\nIf used on only one player, only that player\u0026rsquo;s side will have the background dimmed/hidden, with a fade in the middle between the two players.\nQuirks: If BGBrightness is at 0, then no amount of negative Cover can bring back the background.\nPlayerOptions format: Cover(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: Cover(0.5, 0.5)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; cover\nExample: *0.5 50% cover\nBlind Desc: Blind hides the information relating to judgment \u0026amp; combo.\nUnlike most On/Off modifiers, this modifier is float-based. Any positive magnitude will turn it on.\nQuirks: In OpenITG, the noteflashes also turn into all fantastic (W1) noteflashes, which is why some of the modding community discourages its\u0026rsquo; use.\nPlayerOptions format: Blind(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: Blind(1,1)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; blind\nExample: *1 100% blind\nHideHoldJudgments Desc: Hides the OK/NG judgments that appear upon the end of a hold note. It\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026ldquo;hoholdjudge\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;halgun\u0026rdquo; in NotITG.\nQuirks: N/A\nPlayerOptions format: HideHoldJudgments(\u0026lt;enable\u0026gt;)\nExample: HideHoldJudgments(true)\nModstring format: \u0026lt;enable\u0026gt; hideholdjudgments\nExample: 100% hideholdjudgments\nHideNoteFlash Desc: Turns off the noteflashes for a given column. Since alpha 4.8.3, all columns can\u0026rsquo;t be hit from the modstring (possible in NotITG), but can be done through the lua function. Also known as \u0026ldquo;hidenoteflashes\u0026rdquo; in NotITG.\nQuirks: N/A\nAvailable variants (modstring): hidenoteflash\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, hidenoteflash (NotITG alias that hits all columns), hidenoteflashes\u0026lt;column\u0026gt; (NotITG alias), hidenoteflashes (NotITG alias that hits all columns)\nPlayerOptions format: HideNoteFlashCol(\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: HideNoteFlashCol(2, true)\nModstring format: \u0026lt;enable\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modstring variant\u0026gt;\nExample: 100% hidenoteflash2\nMinTNSToHideNotes Desc: This sets the minimum judgment that is needed to hide the notes upon hitting. There is no modstring form.\nQuirks: The default is set in Preferences.ini, holds aren\u0026rsquo;t subject to this setting.\nPlayerOptions format: MinTNSToHideNotes(\u0026lt;TapNoteScore enum\u0026gt;)\nExample: MinTNSToHideNotes('TapNoteScore_W1')\nDrawSize Desc: DrawSize is a set of modifiers that affect how far down and up the notefield will draw notes.\nDrawSize affects notes below the receptor (usually notes that have yet to be hit), while DrawSizeBack affects notes above the receptor (usually notes that were visibly missed)\nNot often used unless some mod effects need a longer or shorter field, but can be used to ensure a consistent field length across multiple setups through ratios.\nQuirks: The farther the notefield is allowed to draw, the more notes will be on-screen, which can hurt game performance. This is a multiplier, so it depends on your theme\u0026rsquo;s metrics.\nAvailable variants: DrawSize, DrawSizeBack\nAvailable variants (modstring): drawsize, drawsizefront (NotITG alias for drawsize), drawdistance (NotITG alias for drawsize), drawdistancefront (NotITG alias for drawsize), drawsizeback, drawdistanceback (NotITG alias for drawsizeback)\nPlayerOptions format: \u0026lt;DrawSize variant\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: DrawSize(-0.5,1)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modstring variant\u0026gt;\nExample: *1 -50% drawsize\nDark Desc: Dark hides the receptors (but not the noteflashes). There is a column-specific variant and it adds onto the normal variant.\nBecause of this additive property, the range often used can go between -100 and 100%.\nQuirks: N/A\nAvailable variants: Dark, DarkCol\nAvailable variants (modstring): dark, dark\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;\nPlayerOptions format: Dark(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: Dark(1, 0.125)\nColumn-specific format: DarkCol(\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: DarkCol(1, 0.25, 1, true):DarkCol(2, 0.5, 1, true):DarkCol(3, 0.75, 1, true):DarkCol(4, 0.90, 1, true)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modstring variant\u0026gt;\nExample: *0.125 100% dark *1 25% dark1, *1 50% dark2, *1 75% dark3, *1 90% dark4\nDark video example\nStealth Desc: Stealth hides the notes. When activating, notes start glowing white (0 to 50%), and then the glow fades away to an invisible note (50 to 100%). There\u0026rsquo;s a column-specific version. All variants add onto eachother, so it\u0026rsquo;s possible to have one variant at 100%, and undo it for another type with a different variant at -100%.\nBecause of this additive property, the range often used can go between -100 and 100%.\nStealthMines affects the mines only, while StealthHolds only affects the hold bodies (topcap, body, bottomcap)\nNotITG has column-specific versions of those variants, too.\nQuirks: N/A\nAvailable variants: Stealth, StealthCol, StealthHolds, StealthMines\nAvailable variants (modstring): stealth, stealth\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, stealthmines, minestealth (NotITG\u0026rsquo;s name for stealthmines), minestealth\u0026lt;column\u0026gt; (NotITG only), hidemines (NotITG alias), hidemines\u0026lt;column\u0026gt; (NotITG alias), stealthholds, holdstealth (NotITG\u0026rsquo;s name for stealthholds), holdstealth\u0026lt;columns\u0026gt; (NotITG\u0026rsquo;s only), hideholds (NotITG alias), hideholds\u0026lt;column\u0026gt; (NotITG alias)\nPlayerOptions format: \u0026lt;Stealth variant\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: Stealth(0.90, 1, true):StealthMines(-0.4, 1)\nColumn-specific format: StealthCol(\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: StealthCol(1, 0.25, 1, true):StealthCol(2, 0.5, 1, true):StealthCol(3, 0.75, 1, true):StealthCol(4, 0.90, 1, true)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modstring variant\u0026gt;\nExample: *1 90% stealth, *1 -40% stealthmines *1 25% stealth1, *1 50% stealth2, *1 75% stealth3, *1 90% stealth4\nStealth video example\nAvailable sub modifiers: StealthType Desc: When active, Stealth, Sudden, Hidden, Blink and RandomVanish act based on y offset (distance from the receptor) instead of the visible y position on the screen.\nPlayerOptions format: StealthType(\u0026lt;enable\u0026gt;)\nModstring format: \u0026lt;enable\u0026gt; stealthtype\nStealthPastReceptors Desc: When active, Stealth, Sudden, Hidden, Blink and RandomVanish will not revert to zero upon passing the receptors.\nPlayerOptions format: StealthPastReceptors(\u0026lt;enable\u0026gt;)\nModstring format: \u0026lt;enable\u0026gt; stealthpastreceptors\nSudden Desc: Notes start invisible and appear at around the middle of the notefield.\nDue to how Stealth works, values between -100 and 100% usually get used.\nQuirks: When combined with Hidden, the appearance point moves down.\nPlayerOptions format: Sudden(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: Sudden(1, 1)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; sudden\nExample: *1 100% sudden\nSudden video example\nAvailable sub modifiers: SuddenOffset Desc: Shifts the point where the notes appear. Positive values shifts the point away from the receptors, while negative values shift it towards the receptors.\nPlayerOptions format: SuddenOffset(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; suddenoffset\nHidden Desc: Notes start visible and disappear at around the middle of the notefield.\nDue to how Stealth works, values between -100 and 100% usually get used.\nQuirks: When combined with Sudden, the disappearance point moves up.\nPlayerOptions format: Hidden(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: Hidden(0.75, 1)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; hidden\nExample: *1 75% hidden\nHidden video example\nAvailable sub modifiers: HiddenOffset Desc: Shifts the point where the notes disappear. Positive values shifts the point away from the receptors, while negative values shift it towards the receptors.\nPlayerOptions format: HiddenOffset(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; hiddenoffset\nBlink Desc: The notes blink in and out of sight. The blinking itself is based on game uptime.\nUnlike most modifiers, this only has an on and off state. Any positive magnitude will work.\nQuirks: Due to the magnitude not affecting anything and the clock being based on game uptime (unless ModTimer is changed), Blink is considered a bad mod in terms of scripted modfiles, and its\u0026rsquo; use is discouraged.\nPlayerOptions format: Blink(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: Blink(1, 1)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; blink\nExample: *1 100% blink\nBlink video example\nRandomVanish Desc: The notes disappear, then reappear in a different/random column. NotITG supposedly has an offset sub modifier. NotITG also split this modifier into separate \u0026ldquo;Randomize\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Vanish\u0026rdquo; modifiers.\nNot used that much.\nQuirks: The \u0026ldquo;Random\u0026rdquo; feature of \u0026ldquo;RandomVanish\u0026rdquo; was removed in SM5 beta2a, but should fully work in NotITG.\nPlayerOptions format: RandomVanish(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: RandomVanish(1, 1)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; randomvanish\nExample: *1 100% randomvanish\nRandomVanish video example\n","description":"Visibility Modifiers Visibility modifiers hide various parts of the gameplay screen, such as the background, notes, receptors and other things.\nCover Desc: Cover hides the song background.

This roadmap was what we targeted during our alpha 3 stage, commonly known as \u0026lsquo;bronze\u0026rsquo; internally. We had a branch running alongside which was known as \u0026lsquo;silver\u0026rsquo; as it had been tried and tested code from a lot of work done before.\nDue to how little time we had and after the branch merge fail which lost us around 5 months work on this fork, \u0026lsquo;silver\u0026rsquo; was abandoned and restarted as alpha 4. We did not have a properly defined direction during this part of the project, it was more about fixing massive glaring bugs to make the game smoother to build upon, as the base game did not like being changed at all. The other main part of the project at this point was to get MacOSX compiling and moving in the right direction. The game didn\u0026rsquo;t work at all, nor did it even run correctly when we got it working. That ate most of 2019\u0026rsquo;s development time. This was worth it in the long run, as it has made it a lot easier to support newer versions of the OS, as well as the new M1 architecture from Apple.\n✅ Update GLEW ✅ Update and fix MacOSX building and compiling ✅ Fix Windows 7 compiling and crashing ✅ Fix libraries ✅ Change math system ✅ Fix ALSA referencing so the driver works ✅ Fix InputDevice referencing in Linux ✅ Fix clock methodology on MacOSX ✅ Move internal systems to support SDL ✅ LLW fixes on Linux and MacOSX ✅ Rewrite most of darwin code to support Catalina Beta ✅ Move codebase to C++11 Completion Date: 30th December 2019 ","description":"OutFox Alpha 3.0 to 4.0 Roadmap The following list is what the project planned and needed to have ready in time for our first public Alpha build that was released on the 16th December 2019.

There are extra variants for the Y and Z axis, as well as tangent variants.\nCommon values can be practically any value, due to its\u0026rsquo; wide use in modfiles. Try starting with -200 to 200% for an initial effect.\nQuirks: When combined with Tipsy in SM5.1 and earlier, hold bodies may detatch from the hold head.

Project OutFox is a fork of StepMania 5.1.

It continues the legacy of the early pre 3.0 StepMania developers: to enable everyone to enjoy the rhythm no matter what game they play, or what they play it on.\nThe original aims (kept here for history) were as follows, most of these have now been met:\nRefactoring its internal codebase to improve performance, adhere to modern coding practices, and enhance its capabilities on modern hardware and other platforms. Working on support for single-board ARM systems such as Raspberry Pi, including the new M1 ARM systems, and improve performance on legacy systems. Continue the legacy of StepMania 3; Refactor the ideas and visions from the early developers in making the game a fully fledged engine, not just focused primarily on one mode. Restoring and improving support for other modes beyond dance. Provide the facility to allow better customisation and \u0026lsquo;modding\u0026rsquo; of the UI and functions. We are planning to make the project a cross-platform \u0026ldquo;sandbox\u0026rdquo; for rhythm games, rather than simply a simulator for popular dance game franchises. Create a working museum of rhythm games for the newer generation to experience the major Boom of the early 2000s in a convenient way. As Project OutFox is a continuation of the 5.0.12 and 5.1 codebase (not “5.2”), it remains compatible with almost all existing songs, themes, and noteskins that are supported on these versions (if you do encounter odd behaviour or other issues with older content, please report it to us as a bug). Project OutFox is unrelated to 5.1 -3 (sometimes written as 5.1-3), which was a prior build of 5.2 before it was renamed.\nProject OutFox Teams Development Squirrel Jousway Cube MrThatKid Jose Varela Design Jose Varela Lirodon dj505 Community Moru Zerinho6 Moneko Hanubeki Gabrimax98 RodentVienna Serenity Daniel Rotwind shockdude Sevish Melone Colin The development members are the ones that make OutFox possible.

OutFox inherits this behaviour. Everything in the engine is an Actor at its\u0026rsquo; very core.\nBecause everything is an actor, there are many types of actors, which are described below. Not everything listed is able to be created in Lua. Those that aren\u0026rsquo;t will be noted as such. However, all of these can be found in the Lua environment.\nA note on LoadActor() This is a helper function that can be used to dynamically load an actor based on the file type. However, this should not be used as it is more resource intensive and can be easily avoided when the filetype is known. For loading external lua files, loadfile(path)() can be used, though the full path is required.\nDef.Actor Def.ActorFrame Def.ActorFrameTexture Def.ActorMultiVertex Def.ActorProxy Def.ActorScroller Def.BGAnimation Def.BitmapText Def.BPMDisplay Def.ControllerStateDisplay Def.DeviceList Def.DynamicActorScroller Def.GradeDisplay Def.HelpDisplay Def.InputList Def.MemoryCardDisplay Def.MeterDisplay Def.Model Def.NoteField Def.PercentageDisplay Def.Quad Def.ScoreDisplayAliveTime Def.ScoreDisplayCalories Def.SongBPMDisplay Def.SongMeterDisplay Def.Sound Def.Sprite Def.StepsDisplay Def.TextBanner Def.WorkoutGraph ActorFrameTexture It\u0026rsquo;s like an ActorFrame, but instead of displaying what\u0026rsquo;s inside onto the screen, it places the contents of the ActorFrame onto a Texture that a Sprite (or any other actor that can load textures) can read from.\nPopularized by its\u0026rsquo; use in NotITG, although the behavior is different. NotITG\u0026rsquo;s version places the screen itself onto a texture instead of what\u0026rsquo;s inside the ActorFrame and requires basezoom to be used on sprites to make the image fit inside the game window.\nExample:\n--[[ This example will create an ActorFrameTexture that uses a sample BitmapText, and project it to the center to the screen in half of the available size of the viewport window. ]] -- This ActorFrame will contain everything. local t = Def.ActorFrame{} -- First, create the ActorFrameTexture. local AFT = Def.ActorFrameTexture{ InitCommand = function(self) -- Start by adding a name to the texture.

Most themers shouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to touch this.\nLifeMeter Cannot be created from lua, but can be grabbed from ScreenGameplay.\nOften used in gameplay screens. This shows how much life a Player currently has.\nLifeMeterBattery Cannot be created from lua.\nOften used in gameplay screens.

The following page contains details on the BMS/PMS channels that Project OutFox currently supports. This is a living document, and will be updated as progress is made to expand the work to support as much of these as possible.\nIntroduction The BMS file standard was devised by Urao Yane in 1998. It was originally created to be a format to simulate the game Beatmania by Konami. There have been several dozen iterations over the years, and we will talk about some of them here in one easy to contain and read page. Do not be afraid of this format, it is incredibly versatile and have been used to simulate a variety of games.\nProject OutFox uses mostly BM98 (1998 to 2003) era definitions for this file standard, though it is improving all the time. The format is used to simulate most of the \u0026lsquo;Down Scroll Rhythm Game Systems\u0026rsquo; and is known by several other derivatives which we are also slowly building support for.\nBMS charts are mostly composed by artists from Asia, so reading them in non-asian locales can be difficult. OutFox has overcome this limitation in 2022, so if you see any charts in the music wheel with ?????????? and you are updating from a previous build, reset your cache. If you do find a glyph the game does not understand, do let Squirrel know so it can be added.\nThe other two file types on this page, PMS and BME were born from this format and are used for other types of games. PMS was originally designed to simulate Keyboardmania and had a very different channel layout than BMS, but it\u0026rsquo;s use moved towards po-mu / feeling po-mu (po-mu is short for Pop\u0026rsquo;n Music). This had a unique layout for 9 key/button charts.\nBME is an Extension of BMS and offers newer features that were not offered in raw simulators of BM98. This was also used in the actual arcade and console games for a few years in the early 2000s. Project OutFox recently fixed a lot of support for this parser, along with adding several of the missing modes often charted by simfile authors. This extension allowed for channel numbers beyond 00-99 (99 values), then extended to base16 for 00-FF (255 values), which was then finally extended to 00-ZZ (1295 values), being based on base36.\nThe other system we support is BML files, which PMS incorporated by default in 2002. BML adds Long Note (known as holds in StepMania), which again extends the BMS specification. We now fully support both BME and BML fully, including mines and extended hidden note keysounds, as well as player 2 wide channel support.\nAgain, if you feel any particular command or object should be included, do let us know. There are quite a few bits of the specification that just simply have not been considered or added at this time, I\u0026rsquo;m documenting what we do have, and you are more than welcome to give suggestions for future additions. - Squirrel\nBasic Format The BMS file format describes how notes are arranged and how the game is meant to behave if/when a player takes a specific action. It is usually a simple plain text file with the command lines starting with the # character.\nThe file consists of a HEADER FIELD section and a MAIN DATA FIELD section. We will be going through in detail on the most commonly used commands and channels so you have the information here. A lot of the available commands ever offered to BMS/PMS over the years have faded into deprecation/not being used, but the ones we have seen in actual files include what we will be supporting.\nIf you find a file that is not showing up in OutFox you may need to switch the encoding options of the chart, or just wait until the new string system is added in the future.\nCommands are in the header formatted as the following: #[Command] [Value]\nFor these commands, a space between the command and value is required or you will have offset issues in most simulators. A Simple Example of some common commands used in the header field are:\n*---------------------- HEADER FIELD #PLAYER 3 #GENRE Dance #TITLE My Dance Classics #ARTIST DJ Superstar #BPM 128 #PLAYLEVEL 5 #TOTAL 100 #RANK 2 #bmp00 miss.bmp #bmp01 01.bmp #wav01 01.wav *---------------------- MAIN DATA FIELD #00111:01010101 #00211:0101010001010100 Common HEADER FIELD commands #PLAYER n [1 - 4] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#PLAYER 3 This command defines the play style that the chart is set for. In the earlier versions of BMS they also specified the number of players.\n1 = 1 Player or Single Play, with 1 life gauge. 2 = 1 + 2 Player or Couples Play, with 2 life gauges. Mostly deprecated and not used. OutFox mostly supports these and can parse them under the old iidx-* styles from SM3.x 3 = 1 Player on 2 sides, or Double play. Modern sims use this value the most, or just ignore the PLAYER setting completely. Often a lot of PMS files have value of 3, though I have not been able to find out why. OutFox supports the odd use of this command but again most simulators post 2015 ignore this value. 4 = 1 vs 2 Player, or Battle Play, with two life gauges, which was removed in iidx19, has fallen out of favour in use. I have actually only found PMS battle mode files with 3 key vs 3 key chart styles from portable 2. OutFox currently can parse these files, but has no battle mode support. Project OutFox also supports \u0026lsquo;duet\u0026rsquo; or normal 2 player mode without needing to be set in the file itself, by joining a second player on the select music screen. As of Alpha 4.9.8 this was extended to PMS offering new modes with a 2 player option of po-mu for the first time. All po-mu styles (3k, 4k, 5k, 7k, 9k) have 2 player support now, with battle mode planned in the future.\n#GENRE genre [string] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#GENRE Blues This command sets the genre or type of music that the chart is going to play. It could be used by the simulator for sorting or grouping charts, or to allow for just more information to be displayed on the song select screen. The genre is usually written in SHIFT-JIS on older charts, but UTF8/UTF16 are becoming a lot more common, so do check.\n#TITLE title [string] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#TITLE Take (Bamboo) The title command sets the SongTitle and this will be displayed on the song wheel to be selected, as well on the screen game-play and evaluation screen. It will also be recorded in high scores and on your profile etc. Older charts used SHIFT-JIS.\n#ARTIST artist [string] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#ARTIST 立秋 feat.ちょこ The artist command sets the SongArtist and this is usually displayed on the song wheel when selected and on the evaluation screen. The artist information is usually recorded in high scores and on your profile. Older charts used SHIFT-JIS.\n#BPM n [0.0-1400.00]/[0-255] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#BPM 140.35 This setting allows the chart to specify the beginning (or starting) BPM of a song. This value will also be shown in the music wheel, and will be setting the speed that will be used as part of the modifiers / scrolling of the notes. This value used to require a whole number. Project OutFox allows for floats here - you are limited to 6 decimal places - so 143.000290 as an example.\nOlder simulators do not support decimal point BPM values, and you cannot enter a value above 255 as it can crash the simulator. If you are wishing to make your chart portable to other programs, bear this in mind; not every simulator supports this!\nThis value also can (and will!) be overwritten by channel commands/settings later on in the chart.\n#PLAYLEVEL n [0-6]/[0-9]/[0/15]/[1-49] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#PLAYLEVEL 5 The playlevel sets the number of \u0026lsquo;stars\u0026rsquo; (from the old games) or the difficulty specified. In BMS files this difficulty ranges normally from 0 to 6 - 6 being the hardest. The older scale from 0 to 9 was from the BM98 spec, which was never really used much or supported.\nIn some BME and most PMS files, the playlevel can be from 1 to 49. This reflects the style from other games with the wider difficulty ranges, and po-mu has had a wider difficulty rating for some years.\nIn older versions of StepMania, this difficulty used to be squished into a 5 tier difficulty system and sometimes didn\u0026rsquo;t really work that well. It needed to use a hint from the file name to ensure it didn\u0026rsquo;t make everything an EDIT. This also meant that a lot of charts disappeared/were not parsed correctly and was generally not that suitable for use. OutFox has remedied this by fixing how the parser sees difficulties, and also widens the difficulty arc to out of 10 fields.\n#RANK n [0-4] Status: ❌ Unsupported\nUsage Example:\n#RANK 2 The rank entry used in the old BMS specification used to allow the chart artist to select a difficulty on how the \u0026rsquo;timing window\u0026rsquo; would be set when playing the chart. It was designed for those simulators that didn\u0026rsquo;t have ways of difficulty or setting different timing windows.\nThere were 5 different ranks, the last being added by nanasi which was a more relaxed timing window compared to the other simulators. Almost all of the simulators that are active today set 2 as the default. The old ranking timing windows are listed below for historical purposes. They are ignored on OutFox as we have a custom timing window solution, but if you would like us to add this to set a timing system in the future, do let us know!\nValue Label COOL Time window 0 VERY HARD +/- 8ms 1 HARD +/- 15ms 2 NORMAL +/- 18ms 3 EASY +/- 21ms 4 VERY EASY +/- 33ms Most of these timing windows are not really tied to any specific game or methodology of timing, so it is why we made the decision to not support any of the RANK commands: we also do not support the timing system used by Angolmois which uses 6 ranks. We do not support #DEFEXRANK / #EXRANK as they were additions by nanasi and it seems they did not carry over to be commonly used in other simulators. Changing timing mid song is something we could support, but we do not really see a need to add that to the engine at this time.\nThe \u0026rsquo;timing\u0026rsquo; windows used in Project OutFox are closer to RANK 2 to follow the standard others use.\n#TOTAL n [0-999] Status: ❌ Unsupported\nUsage Example:\n#TOTAL 430 The TOTAL command is to set the value of what could be considered an extension of the \u0026lsquo;gauge\u0026rsquo; in older simulators, before life gauges existed. The value of TOTAL is added to a normal gauge to increase it\u0026rsquo;s length. if the value was 300, then the gauge would go from 0 to 100% in size, to the intial value (normally around 25% + 300% for a total gauge size of 325%).\nThis only occurs when the notes are hit and combo is kept, otherwise things would return to the old gauge size. It was more of a consideration on gauge/groove/clear amounts (what you needed to reach to be considered a pass in that song). This did lead to some confusion on how TOTAL should affect the gameplay/level of the chart.\nThe gauge never changed size; it was an off screen calculation on how you could \u0026lsquo;score\u0026rsquo; your chart. Several simulators over the years have changed this value if TOTAL was omitted, we at the moment do not honour the value, mainly because we do not follow the iidx scoring system since 2005.\n#MAKER maker [string] or #CREDIT credit [string] or #SUBARTIST subartist [string] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#MAKER Ima StepChart or\n#CREDIT Ima StepChart or\n#SUBARTIST Ima StepChart The MAKER or CREDIT command simply allows the author or maker of the chart to add their credit so it will be displayed in the simulator. The main support for MAKER comes from around 2002 onwards. It is common in most 5 Key styles to be used, as well as being used on 10 Key (double play) styles. CREDIT is more recent, being seen from around 2013 in charts. I know not it\u0026rsquo;s origin, we support both as to not ignore honouring those that take the time to make charts for us to enjoy.\nSince around 2017, another command, SUBARTIST began to be used more commonly in BME/PMS files, which was inherited from DTX. The sub artist is not normally displayed until the evaluation screen on earlier simulators, but in OutFox we treat all three of these in the same manner. If you are creating a new BMS chart, then #MAKER is usually safer to use for other simulator support.\n#STAGEFILE stagefile [string] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#STAGEFILE loadingscreen.png The stagefile command is used to set an image to the \u0026rsquo;loading screen\u0026rsquo; of the simulator - when the song and options/modifiers have been set, this file is then placed as part of the loading process on the \u0026rsquo;loading screen\u0026rsquo;.\nOn older simulators, this loading process could take a long time, so it was wise to incorporate a loading screen system into the simulator. This has also been recently done in Project OutFox so we do not need to freeze the game while loading these files any more. This file is read in and parsed, just no theme at the moment takes advantage of the loading screen as of yet.\nMain DATA FIELD commands #SCROLLxx n.n [-999.0 - 999.0] Status: ✅ Supported\nDefinition Usage Example:\n#SCROLL01 0.5 #SCROLL02 1.0 #SCROLL03 -2.75 Channel Usage Example:\n#003SC:02010001 #005SC:03000002 The scroll command works similar to how it does in native SM5, but if you are unfamiliar with the system, the value is a multiplier of the speed of the movement of any note on the screen.\nIf your notes were moving at 130BPM, but you did not wish to edit the BPM directly, you could use scroll to change that speed. The game also supports negative values (this has the affect of moving things in the opposite direction), which can provide some very interesting affects.\nThe channel command to action #SCROLL values are a Base36 value which are #xxxSC. There are several benefits to using this system as legacy BMS use items you need to name on each measure, whereas #xxxSC can last beyond this restriction. You need to be aware, not many clients support this system, so it is not backwards compatible if you are making your chart available to other simulators.\nKey: ✅ Fully supported and used in Mode ✓ Fully supported and not used in Mode 📝?

Over time, it was extended to base16 (00 to FF), and then to base36. I won\u0026rsquo;t list the tables in full base 36, as those extra channels are mostly used for player notes and keysounds, so it would be very long and hard to read. This table takes the most common layout which is base 16 based, and is also the most common supported by most of the other simulators. There are parts where *0 to *Z can be used, and those will be noted.\nThis table will be updated and modified as information is found out or addenda needed to fix mistakes.

Most of the community do not use a completed file here however, it is better practice for the chart author to create keysounded files, as charting for a \u0026lsquo;single\u0026rsquo; file is often thought of as lazy.\nOn PMS files, the BGA transparency settings are set here as well for effects and \u0026lsquo;cool/miss\u0026rsquo; events that happen during the song if the user triggers those. On OutFox we support this mechanic, but as of yet we have not seen any files or have had any reported bugs with this, so it is a low priority option. Do reach out to us if you spot a pack or a song which has these channels within them so we can see what they are and how the effects work.\nBMS / BME / PMS Channel BMS Name OutFox BMS Support BME Name OutFox BME Support PMS / PMSX Name OutFox PMS Support OutFox BMS/PMS Status Comments 10 Not Used ~ Not Used ~ Not Used ~ Not Used 11 P1 Key 1 ✅ P1 Key 1 ✅ P1 Left White / P1 Left White ✅ Supported 12 P1 Key 2 ✅ P1 Key 2 ✅ P1 Left Yellow / P1 Left Yellow ✅ Supported 13 P1 Key 3 ✅ P1 Key 3 ✅ P1 Left Green / P1 Left Green ✅ Supported 14 P1 Key 4 ✅ P1 Key 4 ✅ P1 Left Blue / P1 Left Blue ✅ Supported 15 P1 Key 5 ✅ P1 Key 5 ✅ P1 Red / P1 Red ✅ Supported 16 P1 Turn/Scratch ✅ P1 Turn/Scratch ✅ Not Used / P1 Right Blue ✅ Supported 17 P1 FootPedal ✅ P1 FootPedal ✅ Not Used / P1 Right Green ✅ Supported in Alpha 4.16.0 18 P1 Key 6 ✅ P1 Key 6 ✅ Not Used / P1 Right Yellow ✅ Supported 19 P1 Key 7 ✅ P1 Key 7 ✅ Not Used / P1 Right White ✅ Supported 1A Not Used ~ Not Used ~ Not Used ~ Not Used 1B Not Used ~ Not Used ~ Not Used ~ Not Used 1C Not Used ~ Not Used ~ Not Used ~ Not Used 1D Not Used ~ Not Used ~ Not Used ~ Not Used 1E Not Used ~ Not Used ~ Not Used ~ Not Used 1F Not Used ~ Not Used ~ Not Used ~ Not Used Channel 10 to 1F This block of channels is used for visible player notes for player 1. This selection of channels from 10 to 19 is ordered and swapped around depending on the game chosen. This is why in the early 2000s there were arrangements made for pomu / PMS to be split into it\u0026rsquo;s own file name, as it reused a lot of notes which on some simulators were loaded as BMS files. Do remember your target mode/game/style when you create your chart! This is especially important if you plan to have support with other simulators as they will not be as relaxed and \u0026lsquo;wide supporting\u0026rsquo; as OutFox is.\nThe pomu-extended mode which is very common in BME files is one such example. It uses 11 to 19 which on some simulations are incorrectly loaded.

Rather than using one of the 30 spare channels in the lower ranges, these two options require full base 36 (00-ZZ) support to work as they use SC/SP instead of a Hex (00-FF) value. OutFox\u0026rsquo;s BMS-like parsers were updated in 4.9.9 to support base 36 channel values even though not required by specification, so these channels were a trivial addition to our support.\nSpeed and Scroll segments replicate behaviour done with Channel 02/08/09, without relying on these channels changing. They were introduced in the SSC updates to StepMania and are natively supported in the engine in OutFox. These add a new layer of effects to be utlised without using #BPMxx or #STOPxx.\nBMS / BME / PMS Channel BME Name OutFox BME Support PMS Name OutFox PMS Support OutFox BMS/PMS Status Comments SC Scroll Adjustment ❌ Not Used ~ Not Supported Yet SP Speed Adjustment ❌ Not Used ~ Not Supported Yet Written and Maintained with ♡ by Squirrel, with thanks to the feeling-po-mu, BMS command memo, BMS Discord, and Japanese BMS/PMS community\n","description":"Project OutFox contains parsers for the BMS and PMS chart formats, which are the standard formats used in conjunction with mostly the be-mu and po-mu game types.

The contents can be dragged into the NoteSkins directory if one wants to use the old noteskins.\nCommon problems Missing libraries The game might not launch if libraries are missing. ldd can be used to help determine what packages need to be installed without having to run the game multiple times.\nRun this in the game\u0026rsquo;s directory from a terminal to find what libraries are missing:\nldd outfox Here is example output from ldd:\nIn this example, libbz2.so.1.0 is missing.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a list of what libraries it looks for and what Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora package it corresponds to.

A wrapper program called pasuspender can be used to temporarilly disable pulseaudio and make OutFox use the ALSA drivers.\nIn the terminal, it would be used like this:\npasuspender ./outfox Needing to force a different audio driver Be sure to check the SoundDriver preference for forcing the audio driver.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what can be put into the preference, and what it means\nPreference setting Audio Driver Pulse PulseAudio ALSA-sw ALSA, software renderer.

In most cases, this will be in your home directory and be something like .project-outfox:\ncd /home/pi/.project-outfox\nOpen up \u0026ldquo;Preferences.ini\u0026rdquo;:\nnano Preferences.ini\nScroll down to find a line that starts with LightsDriver= and change it to:\nLightsDriver=SextetStreamToFile\nPress crtl+o and hit return, then press ctrl+x to save the file and exit nano. We need to now make sure that something is going to use that file, otherwise you\u0026rsquo;ll find your system will eventually crash as that file fills up without getting emptied.\nMake sure that socat is installed on your pi:\nsudo apt install socat\nNext open up cron to have socat start at reboot by typing:\ncrontab -e\nAt the end of that window, add this line (replacing the path with the path to you FIFO file):\n@reboot socat \u0026quot;/home/pi/Desktop/OutFox/Data/StepMania-Lights-SextetStream.out\u0026quot; /dev/ttyUSB0,raw,echo=0,b155200 \u0026amp;\nPress crtl+o, return, ctrl+x to save and exit crontab. Notice the \u0026amp; at the end of the line. That\u0026rsquo;s important to let it run in the background. Otherwise your system will just sit there waiting for it to quit\u0026hellip;\nNext, create a launcher file that will run on startup. In order to do this, it should reside in the autostart folder of xdg. Easy way to do this is:\nnano /etc/xdg/autostart/OutFox.desktop\nWhen nano opens, put the following into the text file:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open [Desktop Entry] Type=Application Name=Project OutFox Exec=/home/pi/Desktop/OutFox/outfox Ctrl+o, return, ctrl+x to save and exit the file. Make sure you also give it executable permission:\nchmod a+x /etc/xdg/autostart/OutFox.desktop\nNow if you reboot the pi, it should automatically load socat and OutFox for a session of great fun.\n(thanks to Random Hajile for the PiCab information)\n","description":"Important note Determining what version to download Installing the game Portable vs Non-portable mode Running the game Extra NoteSkins Common problems Missing libraries Audio not playing / going to the wrong device Needing to force ALSA instead of PulseAudio.

The following page contains details on the .osu parsing options that Project OutFox currently supports. This is a living document - it will be updated as time allows and we add the support or features within.\nThis documentation exists as a mental \u0026rsquo;layout\u0026rsquo; for me to learn about the format and how best to parse it for the way OutFox needs. It will be updated in a few segments - There may be errors, but do let me know so i can update and clarify them, thanks for joining me on this ride! - (Squirrel)\nWe are calling it the OTO parser as we chose to follow the Osu Tatakae Ouendan name.\nOTO Notedata support as of Alpha 4.12.0 - IN PROGRESS We have a partially working implementation of Mode 3 (Mania)! Trivia .osu is a format containing information about Osu beatmaps, which confusingly contain charts for other game modes as well. We use the term chart around the Scrolling Rhythm Game genre, because we do not use specific co-ordinates like on a map. The Osu Tatakae Ouendan mode uses both x and y mapping for the circles, curves and spinners etc, so this is why a lot of players who play the game call the other modes\u0026rsquo; charts beatmaps, because of the original game.\nAlthough catch, taiko and mania do not use co-ordinate systems, similar to almost all the other modes in OutFox, they inherit the beatmap definition by players of the game.\nThroughout this page, we will be using the chart term, as we do not support the Osu Tatakae Ouendan (Mode=0) mode, as we have no way of mapping the circles/hit objects to the screen at this time.\nLayout .osu files are constructed using sections which contain content within to describe and give information about the map or chart detailed within. Each file will only contain one set of data; it is not like SSC or DTX which can contain several charts.\nMost beatmap artists will include different difficulty levels to what they have created, usually with different mode support in some cases. This allows access to different skill levels and more availability to players, as not everyone is highly competitive or have the means to play one specific mode.\nBasic Format The .osu file format describes how notes are arranged and how the game is meant to behave if/when a player takes a specific action. It is usually a simple plain text file with the command lines made up of key:value pairs.\nPlease note! There are 3 layouts to the pairs, which will be explained further down in the page, so if you are parsing this file, do take note about the spaces around the pairs.\nThe format consists of 8 different sections which detail specifics about the chart. We will be going through in detail on the most commonly used commands and features of this format on this page. We will not be supporting editing or creating this format; The support in OutFox is parse (read) only.\nSection What it\u0026rsquo;s for Command / Content type Supported? [General] Chart general information key: value pairs Yes, Some [Editor] Settings saved from the Osu editor key: value pairs Ignored [Metadata] Song Information (title/artist etc) key:value pairs Yes [Difficulty] Osu difficulty settings key:value pairs Some. CircleSize / KeyCount [Events] Osu graphical events comma separated values Only Background [TimingPoints] Timing and Control Points comma separated values Yes, Some [Colours] Settings for the artist to change combo or theme colours key : value pairs Ignored [HitObjects] Hit Objects / Note Types and Holds comma separated values Yes, Some File Format Layout osu file format vn [1 - 14] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\nosu file format v14 This value is at the very beginning of the file, and sets the version of the specification that the file uses. As of January 2022, This is Version 14.\nThis variable is used in OutFox just to check for the supported version (charts under version 5 are not supported).\n[General] Section An example of the layout of this section is below. There are several items not included on most charts, but we will cover all of the values you may see in a file so to avoid confusion. Like with the other loader support pages, it is better to be complete than omit things. The commands for this section are done as Command: Value. Do note the space!\nThis section covers settings and options for the chart and game-play screen. As OutFox has a very different setup and internal system, most of the options in this section do not apply. It\u0026rsquo;s here primarily for completeness and to explain what bits do.\n[General] AudioFilename: audio.mp3 AudioLeadIn: 0 PreviewTime: 35841 Countdown: 0 SampleSet: Soft StackLeniency: 0.8 Mode: 3 LetterboxInBreaks: 0 CountdownOffset: 0 SpecialStyle: 0 WidescreenStoryboard: 1 AudioFilename: filename [string] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\nAudioFilename: song.mp3 This entry in the list tells the game what music file to use for the chart. It will be case sensitive on Linux/Mac so bear this in mind if you have a chart which cannot find it\u0026rsquo;s music file, this will be the issue.\nThis variable is equivalent to the #MUSIC entry on SM/SSC files.\n#MUSIC:song.mp3; AudioLeadIn: n [0-212] Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nAudioLeadIn: 0 This entry in the list tells the game the number of milliseconds of silence to add before the first sample of the music that plays. It is used for effects or to prepare players for the beginning of the chart, however with how OutFox does timing, this would act more as an offset, and our clock system does not work in milliseconds.\nAt this time we do not plan on supporting this variable.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\nPreviewTime: n [time in ms] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\nPreviewTime: 35841 This value tells the game the time in milliseconds to play the preview section of the song in the music wheel. There is no separate option for a preview file in this format, so it uses a time offset based on the music file detailed in the AudioFilename entry.\nUnlike SM/SSC there is no #SAMPLELENGTH in this format that tells the game to loop or reset the point of playback. It will fall back to the default 15 second length when parsing.\nTo make this variable compatible with OutFox it needs to be divided by 1000 to get the seconds value, as per the #SAMPLESTART SM/SSC variable.\n#SAMPLESTART:35.841; Countdown: n [0-3] Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nCountdown: 0 The countdown happens before the beginning of the first hit object or note, allowing the option to \u0026lsquo;ready\u0026rsquo; the player before the song starts. This option allows the chart author to set 4 different speed values. Most modern day charts set this to 0 (disabled).\n0 = Set the countdown to be disabled, so the chart will begin as soon as everything loads. 1 = Set the countdown to be normal, thus adding a 3, 2, 1\u0026hellip;GO! option that happens before the music plays. This only happens if there is an offset before the beginning from what the documentation says, so it is not always guaranteed. 2 = Sets a half speed countdown; one that is half the speed of 1. 3 = Sets a double speed countdown; one that is double the speed of 1. At this time we do not plan on supporting this variable.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\nSampleSet: set [string] Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nSampleSet: Normal This variable allows for the chart artist to specify a selection of sound samples to be used when setting a hit object. These sounds play when an object (note) is hit, much like keysounds in BMS or DTX modes.\nThe definition seems to imply that there are 3 base types that can be set for the whole song, and one can also change this variable in the [HitObjects] and the [TimingPoints] sections described further down.\nOutFox will honour specific hitsounds as keysounds in modes that support them, but at this time we do not have a custom sound sample pack for this command. If you wish to have this supported, do let us know for consideration!\nNormal = Set the sound sample packs to normal. Soft = Set the sound sample packs to softer less distracting sounds. Drum = Set the sound sample packs to drum based sounds. At this time we do not plan on supporting this variable.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\nStackLeniency: n.n [0.0-1.0] Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nStackLeniency: 0.7 StackLeniency is used in the Osu Tatakae Ouendan mode to \u0026lsquo;stack\u0026rsquo; circles upon one another if they are in the same place (or within a few osupixels) as one previously drawn on the screen.\nThere is some confusion as to what this modifier actually does, and it seems this is a multiplier in time, most likely from 0-1 seconds, so the closer to 1.0 the more likely you will have a stack of circles, (which will have a number within to show the number of circles one needs to hit).\nAs the stack leniency heads towards 0 there is less chance of the \u0026lsquo;multitap\u0026rsquo; circles forming on the notefield so this I believe is what the variable is for.\nOutFox does not support the Osu Tatakae Ouendan mode, so this variable is ignored.\nIf there is anyone out there with a better/more comprehensive explanation of this variable, I\u0026rsquo;d love to have it so we can update it here. This is just my rough guess on seeing it in game - Squirrel\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\nMode: n [0-3] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\nMode: 1 This command sets the game mode the chart (or map) is for.\n0 = Sets the mode to circles, the basic Osu Tatakae Ouendan mode. The file is a beatmap with correct co-ordinates. Status:❌ Unsupported 1 = Sets the mode to taiko, a drum based game. The file is a note chart with adapted variables, drumrolls and denden multihit notes. These charts will be selectable in the Outfox taiko gamemode. Status:✅ Supported 2 = Sets the mode to catch, a vertical item drop game. The file is a item chart with adapted variables. Status:❌ Unsupported 3 = Sets the mode to mania, a vertical scrolling note game. The file is a note chart with adapted variables and holds. These charts will be selectable in the Outfox kb gamemode. Status:✅ Supported This variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\nLetterboxInBreaks: n [0/1] Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nLetterboxInBreaks: 0 This command controls an [Effect], such as a background or a video. Setting this to 1 will add a cinematic \u0026rsquo;letterbox\u0026rsquo; (black bars) within the edges of the screen.\nAt this time we do not plan on supporting this variable.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\nUseSkinSprites: n [0/1] Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nUseSkinSprites: 0 This command controls a [Storyboard] setting, which sets whether or not the storyboard script can use the image files for the skin in use.\nOutFox does not plan to implement the [Storyboard] feature as we have a modding system built in already, so this setting is ignored.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\nOverlayPosition: position [string] Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nOverlayPosition: NoChange This command affects the readability of hit circles in Osu Tatakae Ouendan mode. It allows the chart author to control how the overlays (the circle animations or hit animations) are drawn. This can make the \u0026rsquo;numbers\u0026rsquo; within the circle easier to see, as well as making stacks work slightly better for those with colour issues.\nNoChange = Sets the mode to the default. Below = Sets the mode to draw the effects below the numbers. This makes the value easier to read. Above = Sets the draw above the numbers. Can affect how easy it is to read, but does look cool. At this time we do not plan on supporting this variable.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\nSkinPreference: preference [string] Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nSkinPreference: Ice This command allows the chart author to select a custom \u0026lsquo;skin\u0026rsquo; (theme) to use when the chart is played. This allows for a new level of immersion if your charts are based on a subject type or theme.\nAt this time we do not plan on supporting this variable.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\nEpilepsyWarning: n [0/1] Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nEpilepsyWarning: 0 This command controls an option to show a setting to warn about flashing colours or lights before the song plays.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\nCountdownOffset: n [0-256] Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nCountdownOffset: 28 This command sets the time (in beats) that the countdown starts before the first hit object or note.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\nSpecialStyle: n [0/1] Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nSpecialStyle: 0 This command sets a different key layout named \u0026lsquo;N+1\u0026rsquo; for mania mode. This option is not used as apparently this can be set within the options of the actual game. Setting this requires compatible noteskins / skins to be available, and a suitable mode layout or it can render the song unplayable on the client due to missing assets.\nThis is not available in Outfox as keys can be assigned as required by the player.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\nWidescreenStoryboard: n [0/1] Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nWidescreenStoryboard: 0 This option sets the [Storyboard] as available to be viewed as widescreen on systems that support it or not. The default is 4:3 for normal play, due to the osupixels 640x480 setup\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\n[Editor] Section This section contains entries for the editor of Osu so won\u0026rsquo;t be used or processed in OutFox.\n[Metadata] Section This section details the main song metadata used in the chart or beatmap that is used when caching, being used in the music wheel, saving scores, and online profiles.\nOutFox does not have some of those features yet as they are being built, but almost all of this section is used in some way within our caching, scoring and music wheel system.\nThe commands for this section are done as Command:Value.

It is usually used for descriptive difficulty information, or to \u0026rsquo;theme\u0026rsquo; difficulties, for example (spring easy, summer hard, autumn extreme, winter death).\nOther authors use this field to also add the number of keys the chart has in mania mode, for example [3k], [6k], [10k] would let people know it uses 3 columns, 6 columns and 10 columns respectively before the difficulty name.\nThere is no specific detail given for this entry, other than it being used within the online portion of the game for difficulty and to give information on the music wheel when choosing a song. It is better to give some detail about the difficulty in the entry given, as you can risk not being ranked, and upsetting players.\nOn OutFox this entry is used for the \u0026lsquo;multi-chart per folder\u0026rsquo; setup some packs have in the new kbx mode. This gives you seamless loading capabilities without having to split up multi-song chart packs.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\nSource:source [string] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\nSource:Serenity Volume 2 This entry in the list identifies the source of the song, or the original media it was produced for (in the case of anime openings/themes etc).

Tag:tags [string string string] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\nTags:japanese j-pop modfile This command adds a selection of words that the chart can be searched by on the online system, and within the music wheel. They are simply space separated, and act like tags on a youtube video or instagram post, allowing players to find the chart.\nIt is important you put useful or meaningful tags in this section that reflect the chart so it can be found!\nOutFox supports this function for chart searching in supported wheels.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value. BeatmapID:id [n] BeatmapSetID:id [n] Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nBeatmapID:0123456789 BeatmapSetID:0987654 The BeatmapID is used as an identifier for the \u0026lsquo;Difficulty ID\u0026rsquo; according to the official documentation, with the BeatmapSetID being used as the identification of the chart or beatmap itself.\nThe use of these is mainly for the upload content system so the web side can catalogue and add the entries to the database. Without these one would not be able to tie scores or combos to the charts played. These identifiers also are likely used for ranking and high scoring/music wheels internally for the client.\nOutFox has it\u0026rsquo;s own unique hashing system and database system planned which will be used as the IDs in this format are not compatible.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\n[Difficulty] Section This section details the main difficulty setup that the chart or beatmap will use. There are several values which change depending on the mode type, as well as the sizes of the circles and other settings.\nOutFox will not be using many of these as they are for circles mode primarily, but the taiko and mania mode changes will be detailed here.\nThe commands for this section are done as Command:Value. Do note the lack of spaces!\nHPDrainRate:n.n [0.0-10.0] Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nHPDrainRate:7.2 HP Drain Rate, usually shortened to HP, sets the rate of health increase or decrease depending on how a note is hit. This is usually a set amount of time before or after, which we call a timing window. The closer to the notes actual time it is hit, the high the \u0026lsquo;category\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;judgment\u0026rsquo; the game records for that hit.\nIt allows for a recovery (health is added to the life bar) on a GOOD hit or better. The scale is from 0.0 to 10.0, with lower values giving more health returns. A higher value lowers the health return gained on the note.\nIn reflection, the drain of this value, which is given when a note is hit badly is different to the value. so a lower value affects the health bar less on a bad hit, and a higher value punishes the player more.\nIn circles and catch this value can also modify the passive rate of drain. These modes have a constant drain on the life-bar. If the life bar drains to 0 the player counts as failing the chart.\nIn OutFox we do not have a life draining mechanism at this time, so this value isn\u0026rsquo;t supported. If catch mode is ever implemented this mechanism will of course be required.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\nCircleSize:n.n/n [0.0-10.0]/[0-10] Status: ✅ Supported (mania only)\nUsage Example:\nCircleSize:3.2 CircleSize:4 Circle Size (CS) is a variable that lives a double life in the beatmaps or charts. In circles it defines the size of the hit objects, within the range of 1 to 10. Higher values helpfully make the circles smaller. In the community it is seen that the majority of the beatmaps use between 2.5 and 4.0. This is followed by 4.0 to 5.7, with values outside of these ranges almost never being used, mainly due to them being too small on some devices to hit, or just too big to make an efficient beatmap that flows with effects (Sliders/spinners overlapping etc due to scale).\nIf the chart is above 7, it is likely that one of the Osu games mods, Hard Rock is being used. Outside of this, it is very unlikely to be used. The sliders in the editor do not permit for values outside of 2.0 to 7.0, so one needs to manually edit this value in the .osu file.\nThe other life this value leads, is within the catch mode. In this mode, the Circle Size defines the size of the fruit and the catcher sprites. It works as above, higher numbers make the fruit and catch smaller. This mode usually has values between 2 and 7, which is commonly seen as 3-4.\nIf the value is set to the highest value, 10, the hit objects will be the same size as the cursor that is shown on the screen to show the location of the mouse/pointer/pen/touch etc.\nThis value is also \u0026lsquo;seen\u0026rsquo; in the taiko mode, however, it does nothing. It is also ignored in the OutFox taiko mode.\nHowever, if the mode is mania, this value becomes something completely different. In the editor it is an automatic switch to a variable called 'KeyCount'. As this mode is a vertical scrolling game, this value is the number of \u0026lsquo;keys\u0026rsquo; (on a keyboard or controller) you will be using to play that particular chart. This is also the same as the \u0026lsquo;column count\u0026rsquo; we have in OutFox.\nThe .osu file does not reflect the KeyCount word. It remains as CircleSize. The difference is, the mode uses whole numbers, so there will be no CircleSize:4.3.\nThe values used for this version of CircleSize you will see 3 to 10. This is contrary to what the official documentation says, it is not 1 to 9.\nOutFox computes these column amounts as CircleSize - 1 as our columns begin at 0. The new kb mode will support all key modes from 1 to 10, with 2 player support.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\nOverallDifficulty:n.n [0.0-10.0] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\nOverallDifficulty:1.3 ApproachRate:n.n [0.0-10.0] Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nApproachRate:4.8 SliderMultiplier:n.n [0.0-10.0] Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nSliderMultiplier:3.7 SliderTickRate:n.n [0.0-10.0] Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nSliderTickRate:7.2 Written and Maintained with ♡ by Squirrel, containing information with thanks from the Osu!

This allows lua files to be loaded.\nBGCHANGES with numbers specifies what layer it shows up on. (BGCHANGES2 = Layer 2)\nBGCHANGE format: beat=file_or_folder=update_rate=crossfade=stretchrewind=stretchnoloop=Effect=File2=Transition=Color1=Color2\nbeat: The beat this BGCHANGE occurs on. Can be negative to start before the first beat. file_or_folder: The relative path to the file to use for the BGCHANGE. Lua files are allowed. If a folder is given, it looks for \u0026ldquo;default.lua\u0026rdquo;. update_rate: The update rate of the BGCHANGE. crossfade: set to 1 if using a crossfade. Overriden by Effect. stretchrewind: set to 1 if using stretchrewind. Overriden by Effect. stretchnoloop: set to 1 if using stretchnoloop. Overriden by Effect. Effect: What BackgroundEffect to use. File2: The second file to load for this BGCHANGE. Transition: How the background transitions to this. Color1/Color2: Formatted as red^green^blue^alpha, with the values being from 1 to 0, Passed to the BackgroundEffect with the LuaThreadVaraible \u0026ldquo;Color1\u0026rdquo;/\u0026ldquo;Color2\u0026rdquo; in web hexadecimal format as a string. Alpha is optional. Often, a last entry with \u0026ldquo;-nosongbg-\u0026rdquo; as the file is placed so the song\u0026rsquo;s starting background doesn\u0026rsquo;t show up at the end.\nExample:\n#BGCHANGES:0.000=blossom1.jpg=1.000=1=0=1===CrossFade==, 52.000=blossom2.jpg=1.000=0=0=1=====, 164.000=blossom1.jpg=1.000=0=0=1=====, 229.000=blossom3.jpg=1.000=0=0=1=====, 302.000=blossom1.jpg=1.000=0=0=1=====, 99999=-nosongbg-=1.000=0=0=0 // don\u0026#39;t automatically add -songbackground- ; The second line explained: 52.000=blossom2.jpg=1.000=0=0=1=====\nBeat = 52 File = \u0026ldquo;blossom2.jpg\u0026rdquo; Update rate = 1 Crossfade: off stretchrewind: off stretchnoloop: on Effect: none (Does not override the above three) File2: none (Nothing loads in the second slot) Transition: none (The first line uses \u0026ldquo;CrossFade\u0026rdquo;) Color1: none Color2: none FGCHANGES Like BGCHANGES, FGCHANGES follow the same format, but happen in a Foregound layer, above the players and most everything else. Commonly used in gimmick files to script modifiers or other visual aspects.\nExample:\n#FGCHANGES:0.000=lua=1.000=0=0=1=====; KEYSOUNDS Specifies what files to load as keysounds. Uses relative paths.\nExample:\n#KEYSOUNDS:pf_24_c#+.ogg,ba_op1.ogg,dr_hho.ogg,dr_rs.ogg,dr_bd8.ogg,dr_cs8.ogg,sq_a.ogg,pc_c.ogg,pf_op11.ogg; OFFSET Defines when beat 0 starts, in seconds. Charts made for the ITG meta tend to have an extra positive 9 ms added.\nExample:\n#OFFSET:-0.611000; STOPS / FREEZES Defines where stops in the song happen. The first parameter is the beat, and the second parameter is how long the stop is, in seconds.\nExample:\n#STOPS:46.250000=0.030000, 46.500000=0.030000, 46.750000=0.030000; BPMS Defines the BPMs the song has. A song must have at least one BPM at beat 0.\nThe first parameter is the beat, and the second parameter is the actual BPM.\nExample:\n#BPMS:0.000=140.250, 48.000=93.500, 48.333=62.333; TIMESIGNATURES Defines the time signatures of the song. Most songs default to 4/4 as their starting signature. There are three parameters: beat, numerator and denominator. The last two parameters must be greater than or equal to 1.\nCurrently, this only affects the measure lines.\nExample:\n#TIMESIGNATURES:0.000=4=4; ATTACKS These are course-style scripted modifiers written into the simfile. Unlike most sections, this is seconds-based instead of beat-based, to allow for modifiers during stops.\nThe format of an attacks entry is this: TIME=seconds:END/LEN=endtime/lengthtime:MODS=modstring\nInternally, entries that use END are converted into LEN.\nExample:\n#ATTACKS:TIME=1.618:END=3.166:MODS=*32 Invert, *32 No Flip :TIME=2.004:END=3.166:MODS=*32 No Invert, *32 No Flip :TIME=2.392:LEN=0.1:MODS=*64 30% Mini :TIME=2.489:LEN=0.1:MODS=*64 60% Mini; DELAYS Specifies the Delay segments for the song. The first parameter is the beat, and the second parameter is the duration in seconds. Appears to have been added since SM-SSC.\nExample:\n#DELAYS:488.000=0.050; TICKCOUNTS Specifies how many checkpoints a hold has in a beat. The default value is 4. This only gets used in the pump game mode. The first parameter is the beat, and the second parameter is the number of checkpoints to use. Appears to have been added since SM-SSC.\nExample:\n#TICKCOUNTS:0.000000=4, 50.000=16; NOTES / NOTES2 NOTES2 is written when keysounds are used, but both are read in the same way.\nNotedata specs Notedata has 6 parameters:\nSteps Type: follows the format game-style. eg: pump-doubles Description: a string that usually has the chart creator\u0026rsquo;s name or chart information. Difficulty: The difficulty of the chart. Chart Meter: the difficulty number. Various chart metas follow different number scales. Radar Values: The 5 radar values based off of DDR\u0026rsquo;s. The order is this: Stream, Voltage, Air, Freeze, Chaos. The game calculates this itself when writing the SM file. Notes: the actual notedata the game reads in to create the chart one plays. Special cases There are two special cases involving the Hard difficulty. If the description is \u0026ldquo;smaniac\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;challenge\u0026rdquo;, it gets read into the Challenge difficulty.\nNote layout Each measure has a minumum of four lines, with each measure being comma separated. The number of characters per row corresponds to the number of columns the mode has. (eg: dance-single has four columns, so each row has four characters)\n4 rows per measure allows for 4ths, 8 rows per measure allows for 8ths, 16 rows per measure allows for 16ths, etc.\nNote Types The following table shows what character corresponds to what note type (not including characters introduced by SSC)\nNote Character Note Type Quirks 0 empty N/A 1 Tap Note N/A 2 Hold Note Head N/A 4 Roll Note Head N/A 3 Hold \u0026amp; Roll Note Tail Having a 3 without a corresponding 2 or 4 will result in warnings. M Mines N/A K AutoKeysounds N/A L Lifts N/A F Fakes They can only be fake taps. You can\u0026rsquo;t do fake holds with this. Attack Notes Attacks can be attatched to notes by having {} after the note.\nThe format is {modstring:lengthseconds}\nWhen hitting a note with an attack, the attack gets applied for the player as a whole for the given duration.\nKeysounds Keysounds can be attached to a note by having [] after the note.\nThe format is [index], with index starting at 0, and corresponding to the order listed in #KEYSOUNDS.\nExample:\n#NOTES: dance-single: Charter Man: Easy: 4: 0.503,7.2,0,0,0: L000 00F4 0000 0003 , 1000 0200 00M0 A[0]000 0300 0000 0001{tipsy,50%bumpy:5.2} 0000 ; Deprecated / Cache Sections These sections are considered unused or ignored in normal simfiles due to being replaced, removed or being used in cache files instead.\nMUSICLENGTH Specifies how long the music is, in seconds. Used in the cache variant of the SM format.\nExample:\n#MUSICLENGTH:64.052; MUSICBYTES Just flat out ignored. No-one seems to know what this was for. LASTBEATHINT Specifies a custom last beat for the song. Phased out at some point. Example:\n#LASTBEATHINT:211.000000; FIRSTBEAT Specifies the first beat in the song. Used in the cache variant of the SM format. Phased out at some point. Example:\n#FIRSTBEAT:10.348; LASTBEAT Specifies the last beat in the song. Used in the cache variant of the SM format. Phased out at some point. Example:\n#LASTBEAT:128.600; SONGFILENAME The full path to the simfile itself. Used in the cache variant of the SM format. Moved into the SSC cache format.\nExample:\n#SONGFILENAME:/AdditionalSongs/UPS 4/Brain Power/Noma - Brain Power.sm; HASMUSIC Used in the cache variant of the SM format. Moved into the SSC cache format.\nExample:\n#HASMUSIC:1; HASBANNER Used in the cache variant of the SM format. Moved into the SSC cache format.\nExample:\n#HASBANNER:0; SAMPLEPATH Defines the path to the separate sample audio. Phased out at some point.

The following page contains details on the Taiko parsing options that Project OutFox currently supports. This is a living document - it will be incomplete as Squirrel finds time to update and confirm/clarify items that are missing or unknown.\nTJA Notedata support as of Alpha 4.19.0 - 60% Complete! Headers The mode uses a selection of headers to set up the playfield/notefield, which appear to be based off of the old BMS style loading mechanisms. We\u0026rsquo;ll list the known ones and whether or not Project OutFox supports them.\nUnlike it\u0026rsquo;s BMS History, TJA files do not use the # delimiter to begin a line. In BMS to note the title of a song, it would be #TITLE, and in TJA, it uses just TITLE. Bear this in mind if you are converting from BMS/PMS files that the parsers for other simulators will not expect the # to be used. We will list them as per what we can find out about the TJA Specification, so do check back regularly, as this information will change from time to time as we get more familiar with this game mode and the format nuances it uses.\nSomething important to note, There are no spaces after the : in the headers. If you are using a known editor, this won\u0026rsquo;t be a problem. However if you are converting from BMS/PMS, these will not have a : at all and this can lead to information being missed in the way the game parses your chart. It will also make your .tja incompatible with other taikojiro simulators.\nTITLE This header is self explanatory, and it sets the title of the song/chart that will be played. It is very often done in SHIFT-JIS encoding on older files, however on more modern charts, this is using UTF-8 / UTF-8 BOM.\nExample:\nTITLE:My Favourite Song SUBTITLE This header replaces the #ARTIST tag that BMS/PMS uses, so remember to use it in this way. It again used to be written in SHIFT-JIS on older files, but please use UTF-8, as this is the standard now.\nSubtitles can be hidden on the evaluation screen by adding -- before the title begins. If you wish to show the subtitle on the evaluation screen (the default) you can add ++. It is not actually necessary to use this notation on OutFox, but for compatibility with other simulators, it is best to set this to either visible or hide. Be aware, only -- works on other simulations, so if you want to keep compatibility, do not use the other two options (++SUBTITLE/SUBTITLE).\nExample:\nSUBTITLE:My Favourite Artists To hide on evaluation:\nSUBTITLE:--My Favourite Artists To show on evaluation\nSUBTITLE:++My Favourite Artists BPM This header specifies the beginning or \u0026lsquo;starting\u0026rsquo; BPM (Beats Per Minute) of a song. This is the same as the #BPM used in BMS. It is usually a whole number, but floating point/decimal point is also permitted, though these are not completely in the specification.\nExample:\nBPM:145 or\nBPM:128.35 OFFSET The offset of a song, or where you want the song to begin, is set using seconds. In Taiko mode, this will correspond to the first \u0026lsquo;beat bar\u0026rsquo; you see, then the metronome system will continue from that. If you do not use an editor that allows you to see the waveform, this can be trial and error until it is synched up. You can use negative values, to start before the song starts, or positive values, which is after the song starts. Either of these are supported.\nExample\nOFFSET:-1.785 or\nOFFSET:3.32 WAVE This header sets the file name of the song you wish to play. You do need to bear in mind, this is case sensitive. On Linux and Mac OS specifically, you must ensure that this entry matches the file name on the disc EXACTLY, or you will be greeted with silence when in game. For OutFox, you have the choice of the following supported file formats:\nOGG (Recommended if you wish to make your .tja compatible with other simulators) MP3 WAV OPUS FLAC This header is similar to the #WAVzz header used in BMS, except we\u0026rsquo;re only calling the one for this mode. Do ensure your file is encoded to 44.1kHz (44,100) as some older OGG encoders can do weird things to your file. If you\u0026rsquo;re ever unsure, use the program MediaInfo which is a handy little program for media file information. Most simulators will not play bad or slightly corrupted files, so this is something to take into consideration when creating your chart, so take a moment to check the file is good.\nExample\nWAVE:Iliketodrum.ogg or\nWAVE:HitMeinmyFace.flac SONGVOL This header sets the play volume of the song when screen gameplay starts. It is independent of the game volume, or the volume you set with the F3 option. Use this sparingly! You can make the sound of your chart be bad for players if you set it too quietly for example. It defaults to 100, which is the normal setting for a sound in the game, and in other simulators as well. It is not recommended to use values over 100, as this will cause distortion and clipping in the output, and will potentially sound awful.\nExample\nSONGVOL:100 SEVOL This header sets the play volume of the sound effects used when screen gameplay starts. It is independent of the game volume, or the volume you set with the F3 option. Use this sparingly! You can make the sound of your chart be bad for players if you set it too quietly for example. It defaults to 100, which is the normal setting for a sound in the game, and in other simulators as well. It is not recommended to use values over 100, as this will cause distortion and clipping in the output, and will potentially sound awful.\nExample\nSEVOL:100 DEMOSTART This allows for the preview of the song file set in WAVE. It is set to play when in screen select music, (The music wheel) and will play from the point chosen here. This system mimicks the #PREVIEW system in BMS, but does not require you to load two files. It simply uses the one song file, and will play from the point selected.\nYou need to set a time within the file, or this can cause issues with some simulators. If your song file was 93 seconds long, and you set DEMOSTART:99, this can cause undesirable behaviour in other simulators. If the number is invalid in OutFox, it will just play from the beginning, so do set this right!\nExample\nDEMOSTART:22.65 LEVEL The level entry sets the amount of stars that the player will see and this will signify the difficulty of the chart. It is set from a scale of 1 to 10, and will set the difficulty in the game. Some simulators can also take the COURSE name to set the difficulty. It is similar to how the PLAYLEVEL works in BMS. Bear in mind that maximum star ratings aren\u0026rsquo;t the same between difficulties:\n1-5 kantan (Easy) 1-7 futsuu (Normal) 1-8 muzu (Hard) 1-10 oni/ura (Extreme) Example\nLEVEL:4 COURSE This header is somewhat misleading. It is in fact the difficulty of the chart, and it can be set either as a number, or by a name.\nEasy or 0 Normal or 1 Hard or 2 Oni or 3 Edit or 4 Tower or 5 Dan or 6 Due to the competitive nature of the PC based simulators this normally defaults to oni or 3, so be warned if your chart is easier than this difficulty, and make sure you add the correct name in the course setting. It is named Extreme so this should give you an idea of the difficulty! Edit refers to Ura Oni, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any impact alone on the genre of the song.\nUra Oni is an alternative to the Oni charts, which are not necessarily harder, but can include 2 player or gimmicks. Remember OutFox\u0026rsquo;s Mod system is quite varied, and try to keep these out of your files if you wish to make them compatible with other simulators.\nTower is based on the style from the PS2 era of the game.\nThis setting is similar to how PLAYLEVEL works in BMS, but gives a finer set of controls.\nExample\nCOURSE:4 or\nCOURSE:hard GENRE This header works very differently to the BMS equivalent with the same name. In Taiko, you have a choice of 8 different Genres. These will then be \u0026lsquo;set\u0026rsquo; into groups depending on this value. Use UTF-8 when setting these, to ensure full compatibility across the board.\nThese names will override any settings in box.def, the configuration file.\nSeveral of the older clients need SHIFT-JIS, but if you are targeting newer simulators (and OutFox!) then the following genre names should be used:\nJ-POP This is the J-Pop genre, used for mainstream/uplifting tracks. アニメ This is the anime genre, used for anime based songs, opening/closing credit songs, or songs based or remixed from music within an anime. In the western community, this genre also covers western animated cartoons and movies, and the \u0026lsquo;western\u0026rsquo; based animes that are produced by the like of Netflix et al. どうよう This genre is not used that much in modern versions of the game, as it is the \u0026rsquo;nursery rhymes\u0026rsquo; genre. If you are being true to the historical versions of the game then use this genre, but most now have moved into variety and classical. They tend to be more biased towards the easier side of difficulty, as it was meant to open up the game to a younger audience. バラエティ This genre is \u0026lsquo;variety\u0026rsquo;. It is the genre where you can put charts that do not really \u0026lsquo;fit\u0026rsquo; in anything else. In most simulators, a lot of the edit charts go into variety. A lot of songs from BMS and Touhou fit in this category. ボーカロイド or VOCALOID The vocaloid genre has two possible entries to the genre tag, and you can use either of them. This genre is for music made using the vocaloid based virtual idol singers, including IA, Miku, Luka, Gumi etc. クラシック This genre is for classical music or remixes of classical tracks. ゲームミュージック This genre has all the game music charts. This can be almost anything, as long as it\u0026rsquo;s tied to a game; Boss and title music, to BGM/Ambient music, remixes and even songs from other rhythm games go in here. ナムコオリジナル This genre is for the \u0026lsquo;Namco Original\u0026rsquo; based songs and remixes. キッズ This genre is similar to the nursery rhymes set, with the song charts being set for kids. 段位道場の課題曲 This genre is for Danjo Dojo based charts. These are the task based charts used in some simulators. We are not sure if this setting has been used in custom charting as of yet. Example\nGENRE:VOCALOID or\nGenre:アニメ SCOREMODE This tag allows the chart maker to set the game version used when it comes to setting and sorting out the final score of the song. There have been 17 Arcade versions of Taiko and this tag can specify the scoring method. Some simulators do not support score methods other than 1. However, OutFox will support the full range. On most simulators, the default is 1.\n0 This sets Arcade Version 1 to 7 scoring: Less than 200 combo: SCOREINIT or 1000pts per note. When the player then hits 200 combo, it is SCOREINIT + SCOREDIFF, or 2000pts (1000x2 for double) for the 200+ combo bonus. So if the player scored 184 combo in a song which had 184 notes: it would be 184x1000. Scoring Formula: SCOREINIT * COMBO (when COMBO \u0026lt; 200) + (SCORINIT + SCOREDIFF * COMBO (when COMBO \u0026gt;200) Scoring Formula: 1000 * COMBO (when COMBO \u0026lt; 200) + (2000 * COMBO (when COMBO \u0026gt; 200)) 1 This sets Arcade Version 8 to 14 scoring: With this arcade version, we use the SCOREDIFF variable. The combo multiplier rises by SCOREDIFF with each 10 combo until it hits 100, then it doesn\u0026rsquo;t change unless there is a break. Scoring Formula: SCOREINIT + max(0, SCOREDIFF * floor((min(COMBO, 100) - 1) / 10)) 2 This sets the Arcade version to 0, which is similar to how 1 works, but with some different combo multipliers. This scoring system is not commonly used, but it\u0026rsquo;s included here for completeness. There are a lot more Japanese charts with this setting. This scoring system refers to the always-online HD cabinet versions between 2011 and 2020 (normally named after colours \u0026ndash; kimidori, murasaki, red, blue, green, etc) Scoring Formula: SCOREINIT + SCOREDIFF * (if combo over 100; 8) (if combo over 50; 4) (if combo over 30; 2) (if combo over 10; 1) 3This sets the scoring to the newest taiko arcade (nijiiro) mathematically calculates score to mean all-good (dfc, =mfc/AJ/perfect) is equal to at least 1 million with combo no longer being a factor, with much more precision than AC0 (where scores of 1.2 million were possible on note-heavy charts and scores of 800k were possible on less note-heavy charts, all oni). It\u0026rsquo;s comparable to the shin-uchi/true hit mode (other than it not accounting for big notes anymore) Scoring Formula: ((1000000-(time of balloon (sec)*100*16.6 OR hit count of balloon×100)-time of drumroll (sec)*100*16.6)/total note count/10)then unconditional carry to single digit * 10 Example\nSCOREMODE:1 SCOREINIT This tag sets the INITial score for the scoring method. This is commonly set to 610 on Japanese charts, but many other values are seen as well. See #SCOREMODE above.\nExample\nSCOREINIT:380 SCOREDIFF This tag sets the score DIFFerence for the scoring method. This is commonly set to 140 on Japanese charts, but many other values are seen as well. See #SCOREMODE above.\nExample\nSCOREDIFF:90 MAKER This tag is used for the name of the chart artist. It is not often seen in the simulators options, but the tag is available for credit. Works as per #MAKER in BMS.\nExample\nMAKER:Squirrel Taiko Mode Note Types 0 = No Notes Placed, empty Space 1 = Small Don (Orange Note) 2 = Small Kat (Blue Note) 3 = Large Don (Orange Note) 4 = Large Kat (Blue Note) 5 = Small Drum Roll Start Point (Yellow Roll) - Ends with an 8 6 = Large Drum Roll Start Point (Yellow Roll) - Ends with an 8 7 = Where the \u0026lsquo;Balloon\u0026rsquo; (Long) Note Begin - Ends with an 8 8 = Where the Drum Roll / Balloon Long Notes End 9 = Where the \u0026lsquo;Kusudama, yam, oimo, or big balloon\u0026rsquo; (Long) Note Begins - Ends with an 8 A = Large Don Partner, Multiplayer, with the hands (This does not work on most sims) B = Large Kat Partner, Multiplayer, with the hands (This does not work on most sims) C = Mine or Bomb (OutFox and OpenTaiko specific) D = Not Used?

The following page contains details on the Karaoke file parsing options that Project OutFox will support. This is a living document - it will be incomplete as Squirrel finds time to update and confirm/clarify items that are missing or unknown.\nTXT Notedata support as of Alpha 0.5.0 - TBC Headers The mode uses a selection of headers to set up the song metadata, which appear to be based off of the old BMS style loading mechanisms. We\u0026rsquo;ll list the known ones and whether or not Project OutFox supports them.\nUltraStar TXT files only follow the Header metadata of the old BMS system; it uses the #COMMAND:KEY structure. Something important to note, There are no spaces after the : in the headers. If you are using a known editor, this won\u0026rsquo;t be a problem. If converting from other karaoke formats, ensure these headers are set up correctly, or most of the simulators will not read your file!\nAn Example Header Section\n#TITLE:Into My Dream #ARTIST:Lagoona #MP3:Into My Dream.ogg #CREATOR:-YOSEFU- in a Dream #LANGUAGE:English #COVER:Into My Dream-bn.mp4 #BACKGROUND: #VIDEO:Into My Dream-bga.mp4 #BPM:140.000 #GAP:121 #EDITION:OutFox Serenity Volume 2 #GENRE:Trance #UPDATED:20-oct-2022 #YEAR:2022 #COMMENT:https://projectoutfox.com/ NOTE: The chart MUST have the following headers to be considered a valid karaoke file: #TITLE #ARTIST #MP3 #GAP (Offset) (Not all UltraStar versions need this.) #BPM Common HEADER commands #TITLE:title [string] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#TITLE:Into My Dream The title command sets the SongTitle and this will be displayed on the song wheel to be selected, as well on the screen game-play and evaluation screen. It will also be recorded in high scores and on your profile etc.\n#ARTIST:artist [string] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#ARTIST:Lagoona The artist command sets the SongArtist and this is usually displayed on the song wheel when selected and on the evaluation screen. The artist information is usually recorded in high scores and on your profile.\n#GAP:gap [float] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#GAP:121 This setting allows the chart to specify the offset to use at the beginning of a song. This has the effect of shifting all the lyrics based on the value entered here.\nThe value is in milliseconds, and a positive value will delay the lyrics, a negative value start them sooner. This value is used for songs with instrumentals or lead-ins at the start.\nIf the value is not set to 0, then a formula must be used to set the actual time in seconds for the text to be displayed. Using an example line from the lyric (Notedata), we can work it out:\n: 21 2 2 We\u0026#39;ve ^^ Second Column (We use the FIRST timestamp and the second column value for this calculation)\nThe formula to use is:\nDisplay Time = Time stamp of first lyric / BPM / 4 * 60 seconds + GAP so replacing this with numbers:\n21 / 140 / 4 * 60 + 0.121 = 2.371 seconds This means the lyrics will be displayed after 2.371 seconds of the song starting.\nRelative files use starttime=GAP but Project OutFox does not support these files.\n#BPM:bpm [0.0-1400.00] / [0-1400] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#BPM:140.000 #BPM:140 This setting allows the chart to specify the beginning (or starting) Beats per minute (BPM) of a song. This value will also be shown in the music wheel. This value used to require a whole number. Project OutFox allows for floats here - you are limited to 6 decimal places - so 143.000290 as an example.\nThis value sets the speed at which the lyrics will display, a high bpm means they will show quickly, and a lower bpm will be slower. Chart creators can use \u0026lsquo;double\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;half\u0026rsquo; bpm to adjust the lyric speed to help the singer, or to add a slightly different level of difficulty.\nIn UltraStar there is sometimes strange behaviour when using #BPM values of under 120, with the notes moving faster than they should. Most chart creators use a \u0026lsquo;double time\u0026rsquo; BPM to work around this. Bear this in mind! We do not have this issue in OutFox, and not all versions of UltraStar have it, so check before you release.\nUsing floating point values in #BPM can cause issues with tools and features that work with the txt files, as they can sometimes misinterpret what the . or , can mean. If possible if you wish to maintain full UltraStar compatibility, use whole number #BPM values for major support.\n#MP3:songfile [string] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#MP3:Into My Dream.ogg The #MP3 tag is a bit misleading here; it actually should just be #SONG as it can load several different formats.\nProject OutFox is not limited in wave file bit depth, and supports the following file formats:\nwav, ogg, .mp3, .m4a, .FLAC, and .opus. If you plan to make your Karaoke file support other simulators, remember not all of them support these, or have limits on bit depth and sample rates!\nFor UltraStar, if you use audio formats other than mp3, be prepared that those files won\u0026rsquo;t work on all the different systems, and remember any audio format where FFMPEG doesn\u0026rsquo;t need slow indexing for predictive frame access is supported.\n#GENRE:genre [string] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#GENRE:Trance This command sets the genre or type of music that the chart is going to play. It could be used by the simulator for sorting or grouping charts, or to allow for just more information to be displayed on the song select screen.\n#EDITION:edition [string] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#EDITION:OutFox Serenity Volume 2 This command sets the edition of the song, similar to ORIGIN in SSC files. UltraStar creators often put the game, or TV show, anime etc that the song was originally featured in.\n#CREATOR:creator [string] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#CREATOR:-YOSEFU- in a Dream The CREATOR command simply allows the author that timed the chart to add their credit so it will be displayed in the simulator.\n#LANGUAGE:language [string] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#LANGUAGE:English This command is used to give information on the language of a karaoke chart when a user has international song packs, or plays with different languages installed. Project OutFox at the moment parses this data, but the theme will need to be updated to show this information on the music wheel so it is available to all users.\n#COVER:cover [string] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#COVER:Into My Dream-bn.mp4 This command is used to set an image for the song on the music selection screen of the simulator - when the song is scrolled to and is highlighted.\nThis can be most image formats, or a video, but remember the limitations, video covers may not work on other karaoke simulations.\nThese are usually square in Karaoke, and we will use a theme which uses square covers to ensure compatibility with already created content.\nIn Project OutFox we call these files banners.\n#VIDEO:videofile [string] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#VIDEO:Into My Dream-bga.mp4 This command is used to set a video to be played when the song starts on the game-play. It is similar to #BACKGROUND on SSC files. Remember, OutFox supports BGCHANGES which can be used to add effects and flair to your files, but this would need to be done within an SSC in the editor, when we have added support for karaoke in the future.\nThis can be most video formats, but remember the limitations, videos may not work on other karaoke simulations!\nFor UltraStar, if you use files with video, be prepared that those files won\u0026rsquo;t work on all the different systems, and remember any video format where FFMPEG doesn\u0026rsquo;t need slow indexing for predictive frame access is supported. It is common for chart creators to use one file for their video which contains the audio for the song within, and this is placed within both the #MP3 and #VIDEO tags. We will need to add support for these charts in Project OutFox.\n#VIDEOGAP:videogap [float] Status: ❌ Unsupported TBC\nUsage Example:\n#VIDEOGAP:0.635 This setting allows the chart to specify the offset to use for when the video should be started at the beginning of a song. This has the effect of shifting the video playback time.\nThe value is in seconds, and a positive value will delay the video, a negative value start the video sooner. This value is used for songs which may have a slightly offset video.\nIf the value is not set to 0, then a formula must be used to set the actual time in seconds for the text to be displayed. Using an example line from the lyric (Notedata), we can work it out:\n: 21 2 2 We\u0026#39;ve ^^ Second Column (We use the FIRST timestamp and the second column value for this calculation)\nThe formula to use is:\nDisplay Time = Time stamp of first lyric / BPM / 4 * 60 seconds + VIDEOGAP so replacing this with numbers:\n21 / 140 / 4 * 60 + 0.635 = 2.885 seconds This means the video will start after 2.885 seconds of the song starting.\nRelative files use starttime=VIDEOGAP but Project OutFox does not support these files.\nIt is often that files do not contain the VIDEOGAP command, when this happens and a video is specified, it will default to start when the song starts, rather than the lyrics.\n#YEAR:year [int] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#YEAR:2022 This tag simply sets the year the song was created, and is used as a sort option by other karaoke simulators.\n#PREVIEWSTART:previewstart [float] Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#PREVIEWSTART:17.488 This value tells the game the time in seconds to play the preview section of the song in the music wheel.\nUnlike SM/SSC there is no #SAMPLELENGTH in this format that tells the game to loop or reset the point of playback. It will fall back to the default 15 second length when parsing. Most simulators just play from the middle of the song until the end.\nAs this variable uses the seconds value, it is usable as per the #SAMPLESTART SM/SSC variable.\n#START:start [float] Status: ⌛ TBC\nUsage Example:\n#START:27.759 This value tells the game the time in seconds when to begin the song playback. This is usually used in chart creation, as it can skip a long intro to jump straight to the lyrics/notes, or to test a specific part of the song.\nThese are used extensively on \u0026lsquo;multi-song\u0026rsquo; music files that have \u0026lsquo;chapters\u0026rsquo; (One file with different songs inside). These can also be \u0026lsquo;parts\u0026rsquo; of the song, like chorus or verses.\nThere will usually be one txt file for the complete file, with extra txt files for the \u0026lsquo;chapters\u0026rsquo;.\nThe main advantage for using this command is not having to create a dozen audio files for the same song, plus merging corrections from the main txt files to the chapter txt files is easier in this method.\n#END:end [float] Status: ⌛ TBC\nUsage Example:\n#END:187488 This value tells the game the time in milliseconds when to end the song playback. This is usually used in chart creation, as it can stop playing at a specific part of the song. We haven\u0026rsquo;t decided yet on this one, as many of the charts we have found do not use these commands, as we have the end data in the \u0026lsquo;NoteData\u0026rsquo; section below.\n#DUETSINGERP1:duetsingerp1 [string] #DUETSINGERP2:duetsingerp2 [string] Status: ⌛ TBC\nUsage Example:\n#DUETSINGERP1:Shrek #DUETSINGERP2:Donkey These two values tell the game to change the name in duet mode, so instead of just saying player1 and player2 it changes the name listed in that command. Used in charts for a bit of fun. Some UltraStar versions do not support this and will crash, just be warned!\n#VOCALS:vocalsfile [string] Status: ⌛ TBC\nUsage Example:\n#VOCALS:song.ogg This command tells the game where vocals version of the song is for the selected chart. I haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to find many uses for this, as many songs seem to have song.ogg in the #MP3 tag, and leave the instrumental (Karaoke) version not used. I guess this is to allow folks to have the vocals in the background when someone is learning the song, or provides an option in game to set either the \u0026lsquo;song.ogg\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;instrumental.ogg\u0026rsquo; versions.\nProject OutFox will likely have an option to select which one to use in time at the music wheel, if these are found, but if you know any other information about the #VOCALS tag, please let Squirrel know via our Discord server!\nIn earlier versions of UltraStar on older files, #MP3 would have the instrumental version, and #VOCALS would contain an a cappella track with just the vocals, and the game would mix the two together when selected to play the full track.\n#RESOLUTION:resolution [1-16] Status: ❌ Not Supported\nUsage Example:\n#RESOLUTION:4 This command seems to be an UltraStar editor only value that affects the lines drawn on beats, with every #RESOLUTION beat being drawn black. It defaults to a value of 4, and should not be set to 0 as it can make the game unstable.\nWe have no plans to support this in Project OutFox, as our editor is different.\n#RELATIVE:relative [0/1] Status: ❌ Not Supported\nUsage Example:\n#RELATIVE:0 This value defaults to 0 if it is not added to the header part of the chart. Project OutFox does not support this value, as it was used some time ago as an alternative method of charting. What this command does is it makes each line set relative to itself. The timestamp (Column 2) is reset to 0 for each line. The engine would need to keep a \u0026lsquo;running tally\u0026rsquo; of the beats/time separately in this mode. We have spoken to a few people in regards to supporting this value, but most say it is deprecated/legacy and it is not used often enough to warrant adding the code for it.\nIf the demand is there, we can look at supporting it, but for the first instance, we will not.\nNote data in this mode is also set up differently as it resets on each line as so:\n: 0 2 2 Some : 3 3 2 body : 7 4 2 once : 12 3 4 told * 16 9 6 me - 36 : 0 3 4 the \u0026lt;-- Resets here to 0 : 4 6 2 world : 12 7 4 is : 20 7 6 gon : 23 4 6 na The timestamp resets to 0 on each line, rather than counting from the beginning of the song. These files are considered legacy in the community, and will be ignored by Project OutFox when parsing. You will see a warning in the log about the file being unsupported, but the game will not crash like some other simulators.\nNoteData Example NoteData:\n: 0 2 2 Some : 3 3 2 body : 7 4 2 once : 12 3 4 told * 16 9 6 me - 36 : 40 3 4 the : 44 6 2 world : 52 7 4 is : 60 7 6 gon : 63 4 6 na E Lyric / Note Data Column Commands The note data is arranged in five columns for lyrics, but there are exceptions. When a new line is required, there are only two or three columns, and to set a player or end a song, there is only one. We will go through these below.\nFor a lyric note it is typically arranged as so:\nColumn 1 Column 2 Column 3 Column 4 Column 5 Note Type Beat Start TimeStamp Beat Length TimeStamp Pitch / MIDI note Lyric / Syllable : 0 2 2 Some Line Break Column Commands A Line break is arranged as so:\nLine Break Beat start (Beat End) - 36 Note it is optional to include the beat end, as for the line break, the first number sets when the previous line disappears and the second one when included, sets when the next line appears. This is useful for controlling lyric lines on fast songs, or when you want to control slower lyrics that may disappear too soon, or too slowly.\nLine Break Beat start (Beat End) - 132 264 Line breaks with two numbers usually are used when there are songs which have a long instrumental or solo break where there are no lyrics for a time. This prevents the game placing up the next line of words too early, and allows the player to enjoy the solo/instrumental.\nSingle Column Note Commands Note Type P1 P2 P3 These types are for player set lyrics in duet mode. (See below)\nNote Type E This command sets the ending of the track, placed at the very end of the file. Do not place anything after this, as your file will not be considered clean.\nColumn One : 0 2 2 Some : 3 3 2 body : 7 4 2 once ^ Column One The first column is usually a single character, except for duet mode (see below). They tell the game how to display the note, or if the note is freestyle, a bonus, or a line break. Every chart also has an \u0026rsquo;ending note\u0026rsquo; which is placed at the end of the chart when the last lyric note is finished.\nThe table below lists all the note types that UltraStar commonly uses, and a definition of what those notes do in game. Do ensure you follow the correct layouts and setup for your chart, as the simulator will ignore it if there are any errors!\nKaraoke \u0026ldquo;Note\u0026rdquo; Types The file uses line beginnings to set the \u0026rsquo;note type\u0026rsquo; (lyric type) that the player will see on the screen. UltraStar supports a range of these, and they will be detailed below.\n# = Commands in the note data section are ignored. Some versions of UltraStar will crash if this character is found, and your chart will not be considered a \u0026lsquo;clean\u0026rsquo; txt with any of these characters at the beginning of a line. : = Regular Note. This is one of the most common things you will see in the chart, as it sets most of the song lyrics to be displayed on the screen. These lyrics can be assigned to either Player 1 or Player 2 if that note type is seen before a block, (see P1/P2 below). * = Golden Note. This note often has a sparkly or glow/shine affect around it in game to show the player it is a special note. The notes hit are set for \u0026lsquo;pitch\u0026rsquo; accuracy and can account for up to 10% of the players\u0026rsquo; final score if hit correctly. It is worthwhile tuning those vocal chords (or humming chords)! F = Freestyle Note. This note (or syllable) is usually displayed without a \u0026lsquo;pitch\u0026rsquo; value in game. This allows for songs which have \u0026lsquo;spoken word\u0026rsquo; or normal \u0026lsquo;dialogue\u0026rsquo; pieces, where the singer only needs to speak. These notes sometimes show up when a \u0026lsquo;clap\u0026rsquo; is required in the song as well on some rarer charts. R = Rap Note. This note (or syllable) is usually displayed without a \u0026lsquo;pitch\u0026rsquo; value in game. This allows for songs which have rapping or rhyming style sections, which need to finish on time (OutFox special mode), or the player can be punished. Most simulators do not follow the \u0026lsquo;finish on time\u0026rsquo; rules, and just require the singer to reach a specific input loudness when rapping on per beat analysis. G = Rap Golden Note. This note (syllable) is displayed with a sparkly or glow/shine affect around it in game to show the player it is a special note. It has the affects of the Rap Note above. - = Line Break \u0026lsquo;Note\u0026rsquo;. See \u0026lsquo;Line Break Column Commands\u0026rsquo; above for more details. P1 = Player 1 note. Set Lyrics to Player 1 (Duet only). This allows for songs that require two singers to have distinct colours that signifies player 1 should be singing. This note sets the chart to a duet (see below), which means it is more like a \u0026lsquo;doubles\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;couples\u0026rsquo; song in the Project OutFox engine. P2 = Player 2 note. Set Lyrics to Player 2 (Duet only). This allows for songs that require two singers to have distinct colours that signifies player 2 should be singing. This note sets the chart to a duet (see below), which means it is more like a \u0026lsquo;doubles\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;couples\u0026rsquo; song in the Project OutFox engine. P3 = Both Players note. Set Lyrics to BOTH players (Legacy Duet charts only). This allows for songs that require two singers to have a distinct colour that signifies both player 1 and player 2 should be singing. The use of P3 is not common, and we want to use P3 as a third player in a future Harmony option for karaoke mode. E = End Chart note. This character is placed as the end of the chart to set the ending time of the song, and on some versions of UltraStar can be overwritten by #END, though this is uncommonly used by modern charters these days. OutFox Specific Player Blocks P3 = Player 3 note. Set Lyrics to Player 3 (Harmony only). This allows for songs that require three singers to have distinct colours that signifies player 3 should be singing. This note sets the chart to a harmony chart, and is only supported in Project OutFox. P4 = Player 4 note. Set Lyrics to Player 4 (Harmony only). This allows for songs that require four singers to have distinct colours that signifies player 4 should be singing. This note sets the chart to a harmony chart, and is only supported in Project OutFox. P5 = Player 5 note. Set Lyrics to Player 5 (Harmony only). This allows for songs that require five singers to have distinct colours that signifies player 5 should be singing. This note sets the chart to a harmony chart, and is only supported in Project OutFox. Column Two : 0 2 2 Some : 3 3 2 body : 7 4 2 once ^ Column Two This column value is in beats and sets the time in the chart when the lyric or syllable appears. This is dependent on BPM, with higher BPM songs showing the note sooner, and lower BPM will take longer to show. Although Project OutFox supports BPM changes and gimmicks, the format itself provides no options for this at all.\nColumn Three : 0 2 2 Some : 3 3 2 body : 7 4 2 once ^ Column Three This column value is in beats and specifies the length of time the lyric or syllable lasts. In the example above, the syllable of \u0026lsquo;Some\u0026rsquo; lasts for 2 beats, with \u0026lsquo;body\u0026rsquo; coming in on beat 3. This is important to remember as technically you cannot sing two notes at the same time, and it will be impossible to score this.\nMany simulators will either throw an error or crash on badly formed charts if syllables overlap, for example if \u0026lsquo;Some\u0026rsquo; finished on beat 2, but \u0026lsquo;body\u0026rsquo; started on beat 1, this would be considered an overlap. However, \u0026lsquo;body\u0026rsquo; could start on beat 2 as \u0026lsquo;Some\u0026rsquo; would be considered complete, this is accepted. Just ensure that you never overlap your syllables!\nColumn Four : 0 2 2 Some : 3 3 2 body : 7 4 2 once ^ Column Four This column is responsible for the musical pitch of the syllable or lyric that the singer is expected to match or reproduce as the words are displayed on the screen.\nMost UltraStar clients are limited to displaying a single octave on the screen that the singer can see.\nWithout going into too much musical theory, that is usually C -\u0026gt; C. (If you remember the \u0026quot;doe ray me far so la tea doe\u0026quot; song from the Sound of Music These were the main notes of the octave.) At this moment in time we haven\u0026rsquo;t confirmed how our pitch grid will be constructed, as we do not have the limitations of UltraStar or it\u0026rsquo;s derivatives. If you have any thoughts on this, do pop into the discord and give us them!\nThe values used in the UltraStar karaoke files start at 0. I have done a lot of research around the internet, and some people claim that this begins at C3, C1, C0, even C5 in one case!\nBut balancing a midi file of several example tracks and then cross referencing those notes with the syllables / lyric notes provided in the karaoke file shows that the 0 almost always runs on middle C or C4. We have learned that the game shifts the notes by 60 (Middle C MIDI Note) and bases the chart parsing of C0 = 0.\nThe following picture shows a standard piano 88 key layout. I have put this here to show how the format works out pitch and where to put the syllable layout on the screen.\nA common layout showing C4 (Middle C) Let\u0026rsquo;s take a few lines from an UltraStar file:\n: 0 5 4 Hey, : 9 6 4 hey, : 18 4 4 eve : 23 3 4 ry : 28 4 6 bo : 33 4 8 dy! Lets take the note values in column four: 4 4 4 4 6 8.\nUsing the piano layout above, count right the number of piano keys to match the numbers, remembering to count the sharp # black keys as well!\nFour notes on from C4 is E4, six notes on from C4 is F4#, and eight notes on from C4 is G4#. So replacing the numbered notes in musical notation: E E E E F4# G4#. These are the values the game uses for pitch matching, and to display on the pitch grid on screen.\nThis notation also works for negative numbers, you simply count backwards from C4 if the notes required are a lower pitch. Some songs do indeed have the whole base notes below 0, but this is often common with some genres. Be warned not every UltraStar version supports this!\nMost songs that have been charted tend to be within a 6 to 12 note range, so the pitch grids are not massive, and also to prevent the issue on some UltraStar clients where a note from a higher Octave, for example if the chart starts at G4 and there is a note for G5 this higher note would be drawn in the same place as the lower note, as the note would be considered an \u0026lsquo;overflow\u0026rsquo;, and would just be in the normal G4 row on screen.\nWe will add support to shift key for singers in Project OutFox to make it easier for players to sing in their natural range.\nColumn Five : 0 2 2 Some : 3 3 2 body : 7 4 2 once ^ Column Five As I am sure you have realised by this point, there has been a glaring error in column 5 on this little example song code snippet! body has two syllables and should be on two different lines!\nAs you can probably tell by now, this column represents the syllable or \u0026rsquo;lyrics\u0026rsquo; that the player will sing in time to the music.\nEach line in the chart specifies a syllable, it\u0026rsquo;s duration, the pitch, and the time (in beats) it is meant to be sung. This format does not support \u0026lsquo;pitch bending\u0026rsquo; during a syllable, to \u0026lsquo;support\u0026rsquo; this, extra lines are often added which have simply a ~ for the syllable, to show that this is a \u0026rsquo;long\u0026rsquo; syllable to the singer. If we were to extend \u0026lsquo;Some\u0026rsquo; above, with a different pitch, the chart would be:\n: 0 2 2 Some : 2 2 4 ~ : 4 3 2 body The game would show Some~ which is used to tell the singer that there is a pitch change, and to sing it as a different pitch.\nAnother important thing to realise is that the words in column 5 will automatically be joined together. If you forget where your spaces are, you will end up having a sentence with no spaces!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take this chart we used for the column four example:\n: 0 5 4 Hey, : 9 6 4 hey, : 18 4 4 eve : 23 3 4 ry : 28 4 6 bo : 33 4 8 dy! You can see that there are spaces added at the beginning of the lines for \u0026quot; hey,\u0026quot; this is by design; you must pick your space arrangement when making your charts, some editors use \u0026lsquo;space first\u0026rsquo;, and some use \u0026lsquo;space last\u0026rsquo;. \u0026lsquo;Space last\u0026rsquo; places a space after the syllable, so would not begin with one. In the example above, the game would show \u0026quot;Hey, hey, everybody!\u0026quot; in the lyric section.\nIf you are creating charts yourself and tend to leave spaces at the end of lines, or use windows a lot, do take care to see where these spaces are in the file. We will write the parser to support both spacing modes, as is commonly done by UltraStar clients.\nDuet Mode This mode is available for songs which have two singers handling different parts of the song, and often singing the chorus together.\nEach player sings their words, and are scored as normal on the words they sing only.\nIn txt files, these are split up with the use of P1 and P2 in the note section of the file, with many charts repeating words which are sung by both players, but there has been a few charts that use P3 for this.\nIn Project OutFox we\u0026rsquo;re planning to add a \u0026lsquo;Harmony\u0026rsquo; Mode which could support up to five or six singers at once, and this would require the availability of P3 to P6, so it is likely where we will go on this, as P3 usage does not seem common in almost all charts.\nWritten and Maintained with ♡ by Squirrel, with updates from barbeque, and support from Twilight from UltraStar Play, with thanks to My Little Karaoke and the UltraStar community, and Kokairu for their blog at https://thebrickyblog.wordpress.com\n","description":"Project OutFox is working on support on the parser for the Karaoke TXT (UltraStar) chart format, which is the standard format used in conjunction with the karaoke game types.

This document aims to provide help with porting content to and from the different versions of the game.\n\u0026ldquo;Command\u0026rdquo; format vs \u0026ldquo;Function\u0026rdquo; format Converting commands to the newer function format is generally recommended when porting content to SM5. The following sections detail what these processes.\n\u0026ldquo;Command\u0026rdquo; format In SM3.95 \u0026amp; related engines, commands can be defined inside xml nodes like this:\nOnCommand=\u0026#34;x,SCREEN_CENTER_X;y,SCREEN_CENTER_Y;zoom,2;rotationz,180;linear,50;rotationy,-5000;rotationx,750;rotationz,750;sleep,100\u0026#34; (Taken from WinDEU\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Golden Slaughterer\u0026rdquo; file from \u0026ldquo;WinDEU Hates You 5EVR\u0026rdquo;.)\nThis is what can be considered \u0026ldquo;Command\u0026rdquo; format, which allowed for easy chaining of actor functions tweens.\nFor a quick translation into SM5, this can be wrapped with cmd(), but this is considered bad practice and inefficient (And it\u0026rsquo;s still counted as \u0026ldquo;Command\u0026rdquo; format). However, it\u0026rsquo;s used a lot in the past, so it\u0026rsquo;s still here for backwards compatibility.\nAnother thing to note is that the functions inside this format (eg: x, rotationz, zoom, etc.) appear to be case-insensitive, all being converted to lowercase in the end. (Although in SM5, this appears to not be the case.)\n\u0026ldquo;Function\u0026rdquo; format In SM5, commands can be defined inside lua tables like this:\nOnCommand= function(self) self:x(SCREEN_CENTER_X):y(SCREEN_CENTER_Y):zoom(2):rotationz(180):linear(50):rotationy(-5000):rotationx(750):rotationz(750):sleep(100) end (The function format version of the earlier command)\nThis is what can be considered \u0026ldquo;Function\u0026rdquo; format.\nThis is not exclusive to SM5, however. SM3.95 \u0026amp; friends can use lua functions inside xml nodes. But there is a caveat: Actor function chaining as seen in the example is not possible in SM3.95/OpenITG/NotITG. Instead, a separate self: would be needed for each function call.\nEverything is case-sensitive in this format, so take care to ensure the casing is corrent.\nActor Differences Because the internals of the engines are different, actors may work differently with the same lines of code.\nZoom and rotation order SM3.95 (and as a result, OpenITG \u0026amp; NotITG) apply the rotation, then apply the zoom. SM5 applies the zoom and then applies the rotation.\nIn Project OutFox, this can be worked around by setting the rotafterzoom attribute to false, returning the SM3.95 behavior.\nThe notes \u0026amp; receptors already have this active to help with easilly replicating modifier effects from the other engines.\nIn SM5.2 and earlier, this has to be done with wrapper states or actorframes. This is done by having the wrapper do the positioning and zooming, while the main actor gets everything else. (This is still doable in Project OutFox if you\u0026rsquo;re aiming to write content for multiple SM5s)\nZoom\u0026rsquo;s effect on the axis SM3.95\u0026rsquo;s zoom function only affected the x \u0026amp; y axis, while zoom affects all three axis in SM5.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s fine for actors like Sprites or BitmapTexts, but it stops being \u0026rsquo;normal\u0026rsquo; when actors like Models come into play.\nThis not only affects actors, but also affects modifiers that play with zoom (eg: Mini, Tiny).\nA workaround is to either use only the x \u0026amp; y zooms or undo any scaling done to the z axis when performing a normal zoom.\nActorFrameTexture\u0026rsquo;s capture method. In NotITG, an ActorFrameTexture (AFT), captures everything that was rendered before it and places it into a texture.\nSM5\u0026rsquo;s AFT captures everything inside of it (Hence, ActorFrameTexture), and places that into a texture.\nThis difference makes for a nontrivial challenge to port content across if AFTs are in use.\nDue to how AFTs work in nITG, lumikey or chromakey shaders are needed if transparent textures of an actor are needed.\nAttribute renames A few of the attributes got renamed, so when porting content, take care to ensure these are dealt with:\neffectdelay (SM3.95) becomes effect_hold_at_full (SM5)\nhidden(0) and hidden(1) (SM3.95) becomes visible(false) and visible(true) (SM5)\nScaling across multiple themes Most themes made for the SM3.95 era are considered \u0026ldquo;480p\u0026rdquo; because it\u0026rsquo;s internal height was always 480 pixels.\nSM5 changes this, with SM5.1\u0026rsquo;s default theme shifting towards a hight of 720 pixels, which can be considered an \u0026ldquo;HD\u0026rdquo; Theme.\nSeveral things have to be scaled in accordance to this, such as:\nZoom (All axis are involved) Positioning (All axis are involved) Effects (Not all need to be scaled.) A Common ratio would be this: SCREEN_HEIGHT/intended_height (for SM3.95-style content, intended_height is 480)\nHowever, this does not apply to every actor. If an actor is inside something that\u0026rsquo;s already scaled (eg: the NoteField inside the scaled Player), it does not require the above scaling.\nModifier Differences Some modifiers have completely different behavior, which can make porting modifier-related content less trivial.\nTiny In SM5, positive tiny brings the columns together similar to what Mini visually does. NotITG instead only zooms the notes.\nThe only options are to combine column movement modifiers to counteract the movement, use the column-specific variants instead, or use tinyx \u0026amp; tinyy (which is technically closer to what nITG\u0026rsquo;s Tiny actually does).\nThis only affects the original Tiny modifier, and not its\u0026rsquo; variants.\nThe zoom equation is different. SM5 uses this equation: 0.5^strength, while NotITG uses this one: 1 - 0.5*strength. (100% == 1.0 for the strength) It just so happens that NotITG\u0026rsquo;s equation is the exact same one Mini uses for notefield zoom.\nIn OutFox, this can be altered with the TinyUsesMiniCalc sub-modifier. When active, it switches to NotITG\u0026rsquo;s equation, which allows for a wider range of zooms.\nIn SM5.2 and earlier, this can be somewhat replicated by taking the two equations and solving for the equivalent strength. (Doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for negative strengths in NotITG, through)\nThis affects every variant of Tiny.\nDifferences from older SM5 builds Project OutFox changes the default behavior from the older SM5 builds. This section documents those changes.\nColumn-specific function changes Instead of typing \u0026lt;mod name\u0026gt;\u0026lt;\\column number\u0026gt; (As in SM5.1), you now type \u0026lt;Mod Name\u0026gt;Col, and the first parameter is the column number. It also allows for mass applications by passing nil as the column number.\nPlayer vanish point In SM5.2 and earlier (due to a math error), the player\u0026rsquo;s vanish point at the x axis is skewed towards their side of the screen instead of being directly at the center of the notefield. This is not an issue in SM5.0.7 and earlier or in OutFox and later.\nFor example: P1 is at the left half of the screen, so its\u0026rsquo; vanish point is slightly skewed towards the left edge of the screen.\nvibrate() now takes the current zoom into account This is similar to how it behaves in SM3.95/ITG.\nSM5.1 and earlier take the endpoint zoom and use that for vibrate.\nFor example:\nactor:vibrate():zoom(20):linear(2):zoom(0) Would result in no visible vibration because the end point is 0, while in OutFox and SM3.95, one would see the vibration start at 20 and go down as the zoom reaches 0.\nLua is more strict with escape sequences. In older builds of SM, an invalid escape sequence is ignored, with the offending \\ removed. In Lua 5.3 (and consequentally, Project OutFox), this now causes a lua error, which may result in themes or effect files not running correctly or at all.\n","description":"OpenITG, NotITG and SM 3.95 are popular engines based on older versions of StepMania that have communities that continue to support by making new content.\nOutFox contains a similar feature set as the previous revisions of the game, but with some notable differences.

Some songs do change BPM throughout, but some charts do this for doing stutters (when combined with stops) or having notes speed towards or slow down. Visually ignored if CMod is used (But may result in weird spacing with regards to note quantization).\nIn the simfile, it\u0026rsquo;s listed as the beat the change happens, and then the BPM to change to.

If given a length of 0, the change happens instantly. The default starts with a speed of 1, applying at beat 0 instantly.

Every single screen created must contain some kind of class, otherwise the engine will not know how to respond to it and crash or send out an error.

If you experience any issues/weirdness, please report it to us.\nSide note for developers\nPlease note that we are deprecating the use of semicolon-separated cmd() blocks (i.e. OnCommand=cmd(linear,1.5;diffusealpha,1); ) as a means of placing commands on actors in Lua scripts, as this method is a non-standard Lua function that was created for StepMania, and OutFox is not optimized with this coding style in mind (themes may experience performance penalties if they use this method). It is strongly recommended that function chaining (i.e. code such as OnCommand=function(self) self:linear(1.5):diffusealpha(1) end, ) be used instead.\nCan I install it alongside existing versions? Yes. Our installer on Windows also defaults to portable mode, so user profile data is stored in your installation directory.\nIf you would like to have a shared song library between multiple builds, you can use the AdditionalSongFolders preference in Save/Preferences.ini to specify a path. Learn how to here\nWhere should I report Bugs, request features and post game crashes? If you can, do those in our Issue Tracker Repository, by creating an issue it\u0026rsquo;ll give you those exact options that I mentioned in the question.\nYou can also use this Discord Server:\nUse \u0026ldquo;feature-request\u0026rdquo; channel to request features or give ideas. Use \u0026ldquo;bugs-crashlogs\u0026rdquo; channel to report bugs and game crashes.\nYou can also use our forum\nAre there ways I can contribute? You can report bugs and make feature suggestions on our Discord server. TinyFoxes is coordinating and hosting community-produced content for Project OutFox, such as translations and other add-ons. How do I get logs? Go into your game folder and check if there\u0026rsquo;s a file called portable.ini (or just portable if your system doesn\u0026rsquo;t display file extensions). If there\u0026rsquo;s a portable.ini in your game folder then all you need to do is open the Logs folder and you\u0026rsquo;ll find all logs, the most important one being log.txt. (Try to do this after closing the game)\nIf there\u0026rsquo;s no portable.ini in your game folder, then you need to go into a specific path based on your OS:\nWindows: appdata/roaming/Project OutFox Mac: ~/Library/Logs/OutFox/ Linux: /home/user/.OutFox Why do I have to configure my pad while older versions of StepMania could work with no problem? Project OutFox uses XInput, it means controllers need to get mapped first and then never again. It means every single controller should work with Project OutFox\nThe game doesn\u0026rsquo;t even try to auto-map things yet, there\u0026rsquo;s a tutorial step-by-step how to map\nI\u0026rsquo;m new to this community and I don\u0026rsquo;t understand many terms, could you explain what they mean? Chart: How we call Songs that you can play in OutFox. (osu! players calls them Maps) Mods: Modded charts that uses Lua to change how the game operates. Pad Chart/Keyboard Chart: If the chart was design for people that play in pad or for keyboard. Hold: A note that you have to hold to not miss it. Drill/Roll: A note that you have to keep hitting to not miss it. NG: Missed Hold/(Drill or Roll) Doublestep: When you have to use the same foot to hit 2 different notes. RUDRU for example (R = Right, U = Up, D = Down) Ghosttap: When you hit a place where there\u0026rsquo;s no step. 4th,8th,12th: Note types and colors, 4th: red arrow (hit after each beat), 8th: blue arrow (hit after each half beat), 12th: green arrow (hit after each 1/3 beat)..it goes on. Playfield/Notefield/Receptors/PlayerBoards: The targets that notes are going to reach. In dance, the 4 notes that are always at the top. In pump, the 5 notes that are always at the top. Lifts: Note that you have to stop holding the moment they reach the play field. Will Project OutFox go open source? Yes, in the future.\nFrom the Team:\nThe project began as a method to add online and profiles to SM5, but when we looked into the engine to see how this could be appropriated it was discovered just how much in a sorry state the code base was, and it looked mostly abandoned. We spoke to Shakesoda in hopes of a resurrection in the form of a team project, and it was requested rather than breaking 10 years of content and community to take the time to make a proper 5.x build that is stable and supports what the community as a whole wants from the game. This backward compatibility support has been very problematic to maintain, but it\u0026rsquo;s something now we are down the line which we are proud of, as it has brought many newcomers and veteran players back to the community, and provided a very stable experience for folks during the lock down. We will continue to try to attain a near 100% compatibility where we can, and this is taken into consideration whenever we plan a new feature or change engine components.\nIn the beginning of the project we wanted to be the natural progression of 5.1, but due to resistance and feedback from the community, we have made the decision to adjust the returning of code back to the repo in the future. The aim has always been to open source when the project is in a releasable state, which gives us enough time to realise our plans for the project and the direction we wanted to take OutFox in. We read the community loud and clear in terms of their wishes and needs for StepMania, so we will not disturb that paradigm.\nWe asked if it was ok to close the source while this process was done, and it was deemed wise for the health of the repo and the need of people who are just wanting to play. Its why we\u0026rsquo;ve been around the repo but not on it as taint can happen and we do not wish this. SSC did this same behaviour before us, so we did not see it as a problem. Some vocal members of the community disagreed, including some of the previous SMDev Team. We have also been compared to past SM repo contributors who may have left a less than savoury memory in the minds of some, and it has also been hard to differentiate from history we have no involvement with.\nMoving forward with the project, it has become apparent that OutFox has moved beyond a lot of what the community expects StepMania to be, and has grown into a project that is well beyond just being a DDR or ITG clone. We have had to \u0026lsquo;rename\u0026rsquo; our internal branding and naming conventions away from StepMania, this was due to us wishing to license/digitally sign the binaries we make, and with gaining this with the SM name being almost impossible, we had to change name to OutFox. Moving forward we continue to keep this promise to ensure our builds are signed on Mac OS (and soon Windows) so it makes the game play experience better for everyone. With us also releasing on Steam it has become even more important that we continue consistent naming conventions.\nThe project is about providing a free game with unencumbered assets and also packs of properly licensed content for the community, and this covers more than dance alone. We are not for profit, we do not ever wish to profit from this community, as we have been part of it for so long. We will announce more information in due course about our future, for now we are as excited as you on the progression of this project.\nMy controller doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, but it did on older versions of StepMania. Currently the game features two modes: a HIDAPI-based \u0026ldquo;Legacy\u0026rdquo; input system, similar in behaviour to the input system seen in StepMania 5.0, and an XInput-compliant input system (additional configuration is needed to use unrecognized controllers in this mode, see here for more information). If you are unable to map any buttons to the game, try switching modes to Legacy, available as an option in the Experimental Settings menu, or follow the guide mentioned above on how to map your controller with XInput.\nIs online mode available yet? If not, is it coming? Short answer: no it\u0026rsquo;s not available, yes it\u0026rsquo;s coming. Long answer: It\u0026rsquo;ll take a while, the engine is still being optimised and the online system is still in development (being done by Cube).\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean Online isn\u0026rsquo;t important for us, it\u0026rsquo;s a lot, it was one of Team Rizu first plans but the engine just wasn\u0026rsquo;t ready for their plans.\nResume: As your read this, both the game engine and online mode are still in development.\nHow do I insert Noteskins/Themes/Avatars/Judgments/Toasties into Project OutFox? In the game folder there\u0026rsquo;s a folder called Appearance, where you\u0026rsquo;ll find a folder for each of those mentioned features.\nFor Avatars Open Avatars folder and drop any png, jpg, gif into there with any name you want. Now in-game go into Options \u0026gt; Profiles \u0026gt; Select any already created profile (or create one) \u0026gt; edit \u0026gt; change avatar image, now you can select any image that is inside the Avatars folder.\nFor Themes Open Themes folder and drop here any theme that supports 5.x.\nFor Noteskins Open NoteSkins folder, open the folder that represents what game mode the noteskin is made for, drop the NoteSkin Folder there.\nYou can find more noteskins in https://projectoutfox.com/addons/noteskins\nFor Judgments Open Judgments, drop the judgment image there. Do not change the name of the judgments you download, they\u0026rsquo;re important so the game knows what part of the image the game should get)\nFor Toasties Open Toasties, drop the game Toasty folder there. (The game can come with 2 toasties in the installer options)\nI have an ancient Intel Card and the game does nothing but crash! If your log shows WDDM1.0 or WDDM1.1 at the end of the graphics card name:\n00:00.505: Last seen video driver: Intel(R) 82945G Express Chipset Family (Microsoft Corporation - WDDM 1.0) or the log shows Microsoft GDI as the Renderer\nThen you are running the OpenGL crippled \u0026lsquo;windows\u0026rsquo; driver that is downloaded on a fresh install. Project OutFox will not work on these drivers, as we do not support DirectX anymore (the old D3D renderer that 5.0.12/5.1 has)\nThere is a list of drivers at this site location that may help, but for some of these cards, you need to keep your windows 7 install disc handy!\nhttps://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005733/graphics.html\nUpdate: If you accidentally updated your windows to beyond the support given to you by Intel, so you moved to windows 8.1/10 from 7 then there is still hope! you can take a chance with the Mesa OpenGL replacer for legacy software, which adds an API extension over Microsoft. You can find it here: https://github.com/pal1000/mesa-dist-win/releases/latest\nHOW TO USE?\nDownload Mesa3d for Windows: mesa3d-xxxx-release-msvc.exe\nExtract it (either with a double-click or right-click 7-zip) In the extraction folder of Mesa, go to x64, select and copy opengl32.dll In the extraction folder of Project OutFox, go to /program and paste opengl32.dll it may now use the proper dll Also see https://fdossena.com/?p=mesa/index.frag for a windows working solution.\nAnd for a detailed guide for intel users: (Some computer literacy needed) https://gist.github.com/rb-dahlb/26f316c5b6089807a139fc44ee69f0d1\nHow can I know who works on OutFox and who to trust?

On some distros the package is known as libglvnd-opengl.\nMac I\u0026rsquo;m having issues launching the game and I have Alpha 4.9.5 or lower. If you receive errors such as \u0026ldquo;No noteskins found\u0026rdquo; or other unusual behavior, you will have to change macOS security settings in order for Project OutFox to operate correctly. MacOS performs a process every time a new program has been downloaded called quarantine, which will require Gatekeeper (The OS\u0026rsquo;s security manager) to verify its signature. The OS does not trust unsigned applications, and prevents access to external files unless given manual permission by the user.\nTo do this, open Terminal and run the following command: xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/OutFox, replacing /path/to/OutFox with the path to the directory containing the OutFox executable (manually typing it out, or dragging the folder containing the game executable directly onto the window to fill it automatically).\nQuarantine video example\nOn older builds, macOS Catalina also generated a message stating that the game was requesting permission to receive keystrokes from any application. This was a side effect of previous code that has since been removed.\nThe game is rendering small in the bottom corner of the window. This is due to the renderer not supporting scaled screens yet. To fix this, right-click the game executable and select \u0026ldquo;Get info\u0026rdquo; (or highlight the file and press Command (⌘)+I, and toggle the \u0026ldquo;Open in Low Resolution\u0026rdquo; option under General.\nWhat modes does OutFox currently support?

The loader has been present for a very long time in the games history, not adding actual BMS support until 2003. There are still a number of charters that prefer keysounded dance charts, and for that reason we keep support for those in the engine to this day.\nThe mode was added in the 3.0 beta era, starting off life as a simple mode with no keysounds or even using the correct keys. The familiar 7K setup we know and love was added later in 2005.\nThe mode did not see much use and fell into having a broken notesloader around the summer of 2010, making it not work with older BMS files, or files with BME or BML extensions. Many files were misinterpreted or just did not load at all, and some were even seen as po-mu songs when they were not. The game also wiped any BMS charts with the same difficulty or \u0026rsquo;level\u0026rsquo;, meaning the multichart methods BMS authors used were non-functional. The overdue revamp of the loading system in 2021 and 2022 fixed many of these bugs, allowing this mode to function and flourish once more. As of Alpha 4.14.0 the be-mu mode parsing support is almost complete, with only #TOTAL and #RANK support left to implement.\nIntroduced: (These styles are not in this mode, they are here for completion as being history for the BMS protocol)\n4 Key (Up/Down/Left/Right): Between StepMania 0.64 and 0.9 - (ddr-single4) (17 October 2001) 8 Key (Up/Down/Left/Right-Up/Down/Left/Right): Between StepMania 0.64 and 0.9 - (ddr-double4) (20 November 2001) Main BMS styles:\n5 Key (LW/LB/CW/RB/RW/Scratch): First Seen:\nStepMania v3.0 beta 6 - (BM-Single) (1 January 2003) StepMania v3.0.2 - (BM-double) (28 October 2003) sm-ssc v1.2.5 - (beat-versus5) (11 May 2011) Replaced by:\nStepMania v3.0 beta 6 - (single) (15 September 2002) Replaced by:\nStepMania v3.0.2 - (single5) (25 September 2004) StepMania v3.0.2 - (double5) (25 September 2004) Replaced by:\nStepMania v4.0 CVS - (beat-single5) (7 October 2005) StepMania v4.0 CVS - (beat-double) (7 October 2005) Replaced by:\nsm-ssc v1.2.5 - - (beat-double5) (7 October 2005) 7 Key (FLW/LB/LW/CB/RW/RB/FLW/Scratch): First Seen:\nStepMania v3.0 beta 6 - (BM-Single) (1 January 2003) (Non-Functional) StepMania v3.0.2 - (BM-double7) (28 October 2003) sm-ssc v1.2.5 - (beat-versus7) (11 May 2011) Replaced by:\nStepMania v3.0.2 - (BM-single7) (28 October 2003) Replaced by:\nStepMania v3.0.2 - (single7) (25 September 2004) StepMania v3.0.2 - (double7) (25 September 2004) Replaced by:\nStepMania v4.0 CVS - (beat-single7) (7 October 2005) StepMania v4.0 CVS - (beat-double7) (7 October 2005) Replaced by:\nStepMania v4.0 CVS - (beat-single7) (7 October 2005) StepMania v4.0 CVS - (beat-double7) (7 October 2005) mode renamed to be-mu (12th December 2021) IIDX 5 and 7 Key (FLW/LB/LW/CB/RW/RB/FLW/Scratch): First Seen:\nStepMania v3.0.2 - (single7) (13 February 2004) StepMania v3.0.2 - (double7) (13 February 2004) StepMania v3.0.2 - (single5) (13 February 2004) StepMania v3.0.2 - (double5) (13 February 2004) StepMania v3.0.2 - (single5 (edit)) (13 February 2004) StepMania v3.0.2 - (double5 (edit)) (13 February 2004) Removed:\nStepMania v3.0.2 - (single7) (25 September 2004) StepMania v3.0.2 - (double7) (25 September 2004) StepMania v3.0.2 - (single5) (25 September 2004) StepMania v3.0.2 - (double5) (25 September 2004) StepMania v3.0.2 - (single5 (edit)) (25 September 2004) StepMania v3.0.2 - (double5 (edit)) (25 September 2004) This mode was merged back into the \u0026lsquo;bm\u0026rsquo; mode due to a duplication of styles. The IIDX side of the simulator was barely used, so it made sense to move towards the BMS specification which was more common at the time.\nSupported Parser Types: This mode is parser specific. It will only load and parse items designed for the BeMusic Script.\nThe table below lists the supported files and their types that be-mu supports, their key/button value and the original mode the parser is used for (if any).\nFile Type Label Original Mode Key Values Supported Notes .bms/.bme/.bml BMS be-mu 6k / 12k / 8k / 16k 5k+scratch / 7k+scratch be-mu charts .bms/.bme/.bml BMS be-mu 5k / 10k / 7k / 14k 5k / 7k be-mu charts without scratch (as of alpha 4.16) Game play This mode is played default in down scroll, with the note receptors at the bottom of the screen. There is a \u0026lsquo;scratch\u0026rsquo; lane designed to be a rotary controller, and 5 or 7 buttons which need to be pressed when the item reaches the receptor. This game mode cannot accidentally play po-mu charts any longer as that now is done via a different loader.\nMechanics key sounded\nThe notes in this mode are based off of small clips of audio that react when you press a key. This means buttons you press will add to the song being played. Similarly there can be percussion and other sound effects added to these. Due to the nature of key sounded charts, they take longer to load and compile than other charts, so do not be surprised if you see a \u0026rsquo;loading screen\u0026rsquo; for be-mu charts!\nPlay Styles Grading / Accuracy Scoring Health Bar The \u0026ldquo;health bar\u0026rdquo; in this mode is called a \u0026lsquo;gauge\u0026rsquo;. It is a measure of accuracy as well as your \u0026rsquo;life\u0026rsquo;. Depending on the difficulty you need to achieve a specific percentage to pass a song.\n#TOTAL can edit the gauge, and this is a new feature to Project OutFox, as our health bar system was inherited by StepMania so needed a rewrite and new code implemented.\nModding Charting Controls The game is played best on a controller. It uses a jog wheel \u0026lsquo;scratch\u0026rsquo; and two rows of keys diagonally aligned (almost like a piano style), with 2 black 3 white for 5k, and 3 black 4 white for 7k.\nThe player uses a combination of button presses to pass the songs, often using a wrist movement to trigger the \u0026lsquo;scratch\u0026rsquo; support. OutFox supports the arcade style and home console controllers out there, and several players have reported success playing the game on a MIDI DJ controller. Since 4.15.1 with the Up/Down jogwheel support, this mode is even more playable.\nThe original PSX/PS2 era controllers can be unusually difficult to use, so be mindful if they stick or are a bit stiff, they likely need a good service and clean.\nTrivia BMS charts originally were used for DDR and SOLO mapping in 1999 for dance style simulations, and had some obscure channel mapping long since lost to the known world - (no-one uses this older methodology anymore). However, the notes-loaders can still load the common layouts, when the BMS load was expanded, it was decided to keep this legacy in the code. This functionality was broken for a short time in alpha 4.12 and restored in 4.15 due to Squirrel making an oopsie.\nbe-mu once incorporated loading all of the BMS type charts, including PMS, this unfortunately caused a lot of charts to break and not load correctly in older builds of SM5 so this behaviour was removed.\nThe old kb7 mode used a custom channel methodology built into BMS in the early SSC builds. This behaviour was also maintained in the rewrite so those old charts work, however the mode style is different in Project OutFox now.\nAlthough the original spec of BMS supported mines, these were not implemented in older builds of SM5. This support has been added in Project OutFox.\nThe BMS format has spawned many derived formats, with many of these slowly being supported in the game.\nWritten and Maintained with ♡ by Squirrel\n","description":"be-mu seven key long note game-play, default legacy theme\nbe-mu seven key mine game-play, default legacy theme\nAbout History: This mode started life as a notes loader for obscure dance charts created in 1998, with 4 key and 6 key being supported. 4k doubles seemed to appear around 2000, before being replaced completely with MSD/DWI around the same time.

The machine was designed with 2 dance pads in front of the cabinet which contained 4 depressible areas in the corners, alongside infra-red sensors which the player would need to wave hands over to count as a \u0026lsquo;hit\u0026rsquo; in the up down left right areas of the pad. This meant that the game contained 8 hit options. Unlike other dance games of the time, this cabinet did not have a bar to allow more \u0026lsquo;freestyle\u0026rsquo; dancing.\nThe game was only released in the arcade, and was revived by the Chinese company EZ2Dancer in 2004 for the Asian markets, renaming the game to Dance Master Super Station Arcade 3DDX and once again re-releasing it with a new interface and user experience under the title Ez5 Dancer.\nThere are 5 releases based on forks of 3DDX in China, 3DDX-DSS, 3DDX-DSS2 (also known as Super China), 3DDX-DSS3, 3DDX-DSS4 and 3DDX-DSS5, The last release for this series was 2011, and cabinets are still for sale.\nIn 2014, a new revision was released in China called Dance Master Super Station (also known as E5 Online). This game added a 5th panel, making it more like a Pump it Up clone with the cardinal sensors. This game is still massively popular in the Chinese dancing communities and with the sheer number of cabinets made, some say it is the most popular game being played in China at this time. The game uses a mostly Chinese audience focussed music collection, with several being \u0026lsquo;borrowed\u0026rsquo; from o2jam, k-pop and other rhythm games.\nDance Master Super Station has a very wide selection of chart types, targeting the complete range of player levels, with the harder options almost having no hand sensor options, as they tend to mess up the flow of the chart. Many of the charts are brought in from other games, and some do not include any hands at all, following more the Pump style of play.\nIntroduced: 4 Panel 4 Sensor: First Seen:\nStepMania v3.0 final - (single) (28th December 2002) Project OutFox alpha 4.13.0 - (double) (31 January 2022) Project OutFox alpha 4.13.0 - (versus) (31 January 2022) 5 Panel 4 Sensor: First Seen:\nProject OutFox alpha 4.15.0 - (single) (12th June 2022) Project OutFox alpha 4.15.0 - (double) (12th June 2022) Project OutFox alpha 4.15.0 - (versus) (12th June 2022) This mode is parser specific. It will only load and parse items designed for ds3ddx including pump. It will also autogenerate charts based on the pump game mode automatically, though the extended features are not available yet.\nThe table below lists the supported files and their types that ds3ddx supports, their key/button value and the original mode the parser is used for (if any).\nFile Type Label Original Mode Key Values Supported Notes .ssc SSC ds3ddx 4k / 8k 4k and 4k doubles ds3ddx charts .ssc SSC dance 4k / 8k 4k and 4k doubles dance charts .ssc PIU pump 5k / 10k 5k and 5k doubles pump (v0.81) charts Gameplay The game is played in a total of 8 directions, with 4 being for the legs, (the oblique corner areas on the pad) and 4 sensors for the hands (the cardinal directions). There were two types of cabinet produced, some with sensors in the pad area itself, and the other with sensors above the player akin to Para Para Paradise.\nThe game was designed to allow a lot of freestyle movement and provided the opportunity for a good workout while playing. The game screen featured a wider than normal note field with arrows and sensors moving up to receptors. The colours of the oblique arrows mirrors that of Pump it Up using red for the top arrows and blue for the bottom arrows, with the sensor based hand arrows are yellow for up and down (again following the Pump style), with left and right being green. The centre panel on a lot of the earlier cabinets was inactive, and just used for a place for the player to place their feet.\nE5 Online added the yellow centre button which sits under the up and down hand receptors in the note field. This is one of the reasons a lot of the harder charts do not use those hands, as sometimes it has harder to see in a stream of notes. Many of the charts used in early PIU games were commonly used on this game, and the mechanics of later pump games were \u0026lsquo;borrowed\u0026rsquo; for the 5 panel mode. Support for this will be added in a later Project OutFox release.\nMechanics pump holds\nThere is a special system for how pump holds are judged, which is different to dance or smx. These holds can be picked up and regained on a loss.\ntick holds\nThese hold types are active on this mode, completely holding a long note will increase combo per tick.\nfree-style\nA lot of the charts made for this mode do not make use of the sensors, or encourage full body movement to complement a workout style way of playing the game. This is extremely popular in Chinese Arcades.\nsensors\nThis mode uses PIR or photo sensors to measure a movement passing by them or for checking a movement has been met.\nPlay Styles Single - This style is played on 4 or 5 panels and 4 sensors for hands.\nDual - This style is played on 8 or 10 panels and 8 sensors for hands, across 2 single player areas.\nGrading / Accuracy The original 3DDX as released borrowed the accuracy rating from DDR 1st using (Perfect, Great, Boo and Miss), with the revived version of the game using the Pump style of accuracy (Perfect, Great, Good and Miss).\nThe timing windows for this grading system is very similar to the one used in the game TechnoMotion.

Most columns are drawn to make it easier to read for the player, as well as this mode has \u0026lsquo;superseded lanes\u0026rsquo;. This means that there are two types of notes in one column.\nThis mode is typically played using a midi enabled electronic drum kit and hit like a normal drum kit.\nThis mode has default \u0026lsquo;fail at song end\u0026rsquo; as it allows the player to continue to practice as needed to get a better grip of the song being played.\ngddm is a single player game, and is usually played in a wide area of space because of the size needed for the drum kit and pedals, swinging range of arms etc.\nMechanics key sounded\nkey sounded notes exist in this mode! This means drum pieces you hit will add to the song being played. Similarly there can be percussion and other sound effects added to these.

Combo is included, but not something most players care about.\nModding Charting Controls The easiest way to play this mode is with MIDI enabled electronic drums. The new cross platform MIDI drivers added to Project OutFox made setting this up a breeze, and allowed for better response times and a more stable playing experience.\nThere is a MIDI guide here on this wiki, which explains in detail how to set up controllers better for this mode.\nWe have had reports that the rb drum kit can be set up to work within the 5 piece version of this mode, however, as it uses a different input system, you may experience latency (a slight delay from when you hit the drum to it being recognised) which could affect your ability to play. You can adjust your offsets for this, however if you can play via MIDI is recommended.\nTrivia This game mode was added to the engine as a \u0026lsquo;why not?\u0026rsquo; joke between the main developers of Project OutFox. When the community noticed it existed then there was a demand for a parser and proper support. It led to the creation of the GDA/DTX parser, and 2 new cross platform MIDI drivers being added to the engine, as well as 2 previously undiscovered sound bugs being fixed.\nA keysound in this mode is called a \u0026lsquo;chip\u0026rsquo;.\nThis mode needed \u0026lsquo;hidden lane\u0026rsquo; support. That is, two different note lanes occupying the same column. It is a special feature of OutFox.\nThis mode simulates DTXMania, as there is more content for that simulator, and it follows a practice. There are many forks of this project, so we spent some time with the community working out the features to add/discard from OutFox.\nThe parser for this mode inherits a lot of the functionality of the BMS extended set, so OutFox by nature has a wider optional set of features due to this. One can also use PMS, or any other of the BMS derived parser features. We do not recommend this option if you want to keep your charts compatible with the orginal DTXMania of course!\nWritten and Maintained with ♡ by Squirrel, with thanks to the DTXMania community; APPROVED, np_sub and Furukon.\n","description":"Early GDDM playback, default legacy theme\nAbout History: This mode was added in Project OutFox.

This made it more popular than the standard wide mode, and due to this, it replaced the original kb7-single as the mode in Project OutFox.\nIn the final release of 2021, Project OutFox 4.12 replaced the original mode completely with a new rewritten version which allowed players to use a differing number of lanes, ranging from 1 to 15 in total.

The genre for the content was predominantly EuroBeat and featured moves from the scene that were to be replicated from dances or arrows placed on the screen. The player then has to wave their arms over the sensors to complete the movements matching the routine in time to the music. Project OutFox fully supports the PS2/Dreamcast Para controller on a cross platform environment as of 4.12.0, allowing anyone able to play our game access to the controller for the complete experience.\nThe sensors used primarily PIR tech and were bright pink (PS2) or green (DC) in colour, and had adjustments for length and height of the player for better accuracy.\nThe game received several quality of life updates in the beginnings of the project, and the hold system was fixed to be more accurate to how the actual game played on both the console and arcade versions.\nMechanics para holds\nThe official games allowed a player to wave a hand over the sensor before the hold begins to allow them to catch the hold and not be penalised for the \u0026lsquo;wave\u0026rsquo; effect which would happen on a dance based game. The head triggers if the sensor detects a hand in place.\npump holds\nThere is a special system for how pump holds are judged, which is different to dance or smx. These holds can be picked up and regained on a loss.\ntick holds\nThese hold types are active on this mode, completely holding a long note will increase score per tick.\nfree-style\nA lot of the charts made for this mode do not make use of the sensors, or encourage full body movement to complement a workout style way of playing the game.\nmines\nThese notes should be avoided, as they will damage your life gauge. They are supported, but extremely rare to see in para mode.\nsensors\nThis mode uses PIR or photo sensors to measure a movement passing by them or for checking a movement has been met.\nwhat combo?\nThe original para games worked more on the replication of the dance moves and the enjoyment of playing rather than displaying a combo or \u0026lsquo;accuracy\u0026rsquo; score at the end of the song. Project OutFox supports either methodology, as the console builds did have some combo/hit accuracy included in the evaluation, and it is purely up to the themer/creator to add this or just have the score for optional enjoyment.\nPlay Styles Grading / Accuracy Scoring Health Bar Modding Charting Controls Setting up the Para controller is different depending on the operating system you are using. We will be working with the Pink PlayStation 2 controller in this guide, as it is much much more common and we have yet to have anyone ask about the DC version.\nBefore you start Project OutFox, you must make sure you have laid out the controller on the floor, within a suitable distance from your screen, and away from any shelving or things which could be knocked off from swinging arms, ensure good clearance as well from the second player, as you do not want to be hitting each other as you play the game!\nThe example above shows a two-player layout at a convention from 2010, with the PS2 game running on it\u0026rsquo;s actual hardware. For the first time Project OutFox now supports up to 4 simultaneous controllers, (though more than 2 player is not available yet!). It is recommended to use the provided template to place on the floor so the controllers are correctly spaced and you are aware of the space required.\nPlug in the controller(s) into a spare USB slot on your computer, or the dock of the Mac/Steam Deck once you are happy with your placement.\nYou need to run the game once to generate the file we will be editing to set up the controller.\nRun the game as per your Operating system and then find the /Save/Preferences.ini file, that usually is edited for your specific choices. In the future we won\u0026rsquo;t need to do this step, but for now, we rely on it to configure things.\nYou MUST always plug in the controllers BEFORE running the game! This is because the hardware was designed for the PS2, and needs a special routine in the code to function correctly, and this is done as the game starts up!\nThe following controls are only available on Alpha V 041 or later (May 2023) Scroll down the preferences file until you find the section that begins with Input and set up your system as follows depending on your operating system:\nWindows: 7+\nInputDrivers=para,legacy,minisdl InputSetArcade=0 InputSetDInput=1 InputSetHIDAPI=0 InputSetJSDeadzoneValue=3200 InputSetLinuxJSEndpoint=0 InputSetRAWAPI=0 InputSetXInput=0 Linux: (Desktop - Arch/Ubuntu/Debian etc)\nInputDrivers=para,SDL InputSetArcade=0 InputSetDInput=0 InputSetHIDAPI=0 InputSetJSDeadzoneValue=3200 InputSetLinuxJSEndpoint=0 InputSetRAWAPI=0 InputSetXInput=1 Linux: (Steam Deck)\nInputDrivers=para,SDL InputSetArcade=1 InputSetDInput=0 InputSetHIDAPI=0 InputSetJSDeadzoneValue=3200 InputSetLinuxJSEndpoint=0 InputSetRAWAPI=0 InputSetXInput=1 Linux: (Raspberry Pi / RockPi / Arm Generic)\nInputDrivers=para,SDL InputSetArcade=0 InputSetDInput=0 InputSetHIDAPI=0 InputSetJSDeadzoneValue=3200 InputSetLinuxJSEndpoint=0 InputSetRAWAPI=0 InputSetXInput=1 MacOS\nInputDrivers=para,SDL InputSetArcade=1 InputSetDInput=0 InputSetHIDAPI=0 InputSetJSDeadzoneValue=3200 InputSetLinuxJSEndpoint=0 InputSetRAWAPI=0 InputSetXInput=1 Please Note: If you are running a hardened version of Linux (SELinux/Gentoo/Some Arch variants), OutFox may not set up and initialise your controller automatically.

There was no support for the associated loaders at this time, nor any theme or scoring updates. Po-mu was rendered accidentally broken during the CVS era of development on StepMania 4 (January 2007), where it was not restored until Project OutFox Alpha 4.9.8 (25th April 2021) with a new notesloader and rewritten internal code.\nThis mode has been around for a very long time, but has not really had any support or been looked at since before 2010. It was side-lined into the BMS loader, which actually broke a lot of the needed changes PMS actually uses, and as a result most PMS files with 7 or 9 lanes, would be added to the game as be-mu 10 lane or 14 lane charts. It was known there were issues with this mode, but we were not aware it was broken as bad as it was.\nSquirrel would like to thank the anonymous japanese player we\u0026rsquo;ll name \u0026ldquo;竹 (Take)\u0026rdquo; girl, for reporting this bug, who wanted to play Nitro\u0026rsquo;s PMS chart of the song on OutFox, but experienced the issue above, and there were also issues with how the keysounds were being loaded for this song in po-mu mode and she took the time to give a very detailed report, but deleted her account before we could see her username. I thank you a lot for the report, and if you ever read this, please come and say hi in our discord!\nWe took the time to investigate it and it was decided to code a new modernised PMS loader to the game, which now correctly loads PMS songs as they should be. This also removes the oddity and edge crashes when anyone wished to play po-mu mode on OutFox. This song, \u0026lsquo;竹\u0026rsquo; (Bamboo) charted by Nitro was used as a testbed to debug and ensure it properly works correctly in the game, so we took time to fix it so it would be recognised as a 9 Button PMS file. I\u0026rsquo;d like to thank Nitro for charting this as we would never have had the report which meant we could fix 13 year old bugs on our PMS and BMS loaders, and to 竹 girl for taking the time to bring it to our attention so we could fix this properly and have a restored mode.

It will only load and parse items designed for the BeMusic Script.\nThe table below lists the supported files and their types that po-mu supports, their key/button value and the original mode the parser is used for (if any). 18K and full player 2 channel width was added in alpha 4.14.0 so the main support for all chart types is now complete.\nFile Type Label Original Mode Key Values Supported Notes .bme BMS be-mu 5k / 7k / 9k / 18k po-mu in BMS Extended files .pms PMS po-mu 3k / 4k / 5k / 7k / 9k / 18k po-mu charts Game play This mode is played default in down scroll, with the note receptors at the bottom of the screen. There is a selection of different coloured lanes that match a set colour on a large controller. The mode has been extended to support the obscure/rare modes that were charted and these have a slightly different colour layout to the standard 9 key mode. The little notes fall down to be pressed when the item reaches the receptor. This game mode can still play po-mu charts in BME/BML files, which was a common practice up until around 2014. Play is usually on a dome based button controller, layed out in a 4 top 5 bottom button arrangement.\npo-mu also supports 2 player mode on Project OutFox as this was a missing feature from all simulations from the past and was highly requested by the community.\nMechanics key sounded\nkey sounded notes exist in this mode! This means buttons you press will add to the song being played. Similarly there can be percussion and other sound effects added to these. Due to the nature of key sounded charts, they take longer to load and compile than other charts, so do not be surprised if you see a \u0026rsquo;loading screen\u0026rsquo; for po-mu charts!\nPlay Styles Grading / Accuracy Scoring Health Bar The \u0026ldquo;health bar\u0026rdquo; in this mode is called a \u0026lsquo;gauge\u0026rsquo;. It is a measure of accuracy as well as your \u0026rsquo;life\u0026rsquo;. Depending on the difficulty you need to achieve a specific percentage to pass a song.\n#TOTAL can edit the gauge, and this is a new feature to Project OutFox, as our health bar system was inherited by StepMania so needed a rewrite and new code implemented.\nModding Charting Controls While playable on keyboard, this mode really comes alive when played with a 9 button dome controller. The Arcade style ones can be up to 3 feet / 91cm wide, and provide a really good base for passing the higher level charts. The only mode which can be troublesome is 4 button, as this uses a slightly different mapping.\nTwo player po-mu is a new feature for our simulator, and is still experimental. Let us know if there are any issues if you find any!\nTrivia When this game mode was added in 2003, it actually supported all 9 buttons available on the controller, Yet no 3/4/5 or 7 button mode was created.\nThis mode has been \u0026lsquo;broken\u0026rsquo; the longest in the game\u0026rsquo;s (StepMania\u0026rsquo;s) history. Due to the lack of users, no-one reported any bugs until development began on the new BMS loader during the Project OutFox era. An anonymous Japanese player reported a series of bugs and then this mode was properly restored and is now very playable.\npo-mu 3 button was broken due to a channel issue as Squirrel misread the Japanese documentation on PMS so they did not play properly. This was fixed in March 2022.\nPMS began life as a piano format, and when the project sadly faded away, it was adopted for po-mu charts around 2004-5. 5 or 7 key charts need to be in their PMS file to not accidentally be parsed by simulators as 5K BMS.\n18K po-mu was a design by a simulator in the early 2010s, and still is in use today. Support for it was heavily requested, so it has been added as of 4.14.0.\nThe mode has several special background layers that need to have the code finished when the new theme is complete. BGA MISS, BGA Layer 2 and BGA Layer 3 are now in game, but not activated as of 4.15.1. The side effect of these layers is that they can be exposed to the other game modes for special effects too.\nWritten and Maintained with ♡ by Squirrel\n","description":"po-mu nine playback, bun noteskin, default legacy theme\nAbout History: This mode was added in version 3.0.2.

Game types are further divided into styles, which are permutations such as alternate controller usage.\nThe most popular game type, dance, is placed at the top. If this is your first time playing OutFox, this is a straightforward and easy-to-understand game mode with plenty of content readily available for download.\nSongs that do not support the currently selected game mode will not display in the song list. Please ensure you are using the correct game mode for the content you are trying to play.\nTip: You can switch between game types at any time using the \u0026ldquo;Select Game\u0026rdquo; button on the main menu.\nInstall songs While Project OutFox does include a few sample songs, you will probably want to add more. We support a number of formats, including SM, SSC, SMA, DWI, BMS, DTX, .CHART, and KSF.\nThere are countless community resources for song packs. A great appetizer is our own project, OutFox Serenity.\nPlace downloaded songs into the Songs folder inside the game\u0026rsquo;s installation directory, or alternatively in the User folder.\n~/Library/Application Support/Project OutFox/ on macOS ~/.project-outfox/ on Linux %APPDATA%\\Project OutFox on Windows This folder is divided into Groups (also sometimes known as \u0026ldquo;packs\u0026rdquo;). Groups, in turn, contain folders for each song.\nHere is an example of how the folder structure would look for the song highlighted in the example screenshot.\nSongs │ └───Club Fantastic Season 1 (GROUP) │ │ │ └───COOL_EXCEPTION (SONG) │ │ │ │ COOL_EXCEPTION.ssc │ │ COOL_EXCEPTION.ogg │ │ COOL_EXCEPTION-bg.png │ │ COOL_EXCEPTION-bn.png │ │ COOL_EXCEPTION-jk.png Packs are typically distributed as ZIP files. Extract the archive with your preferred software, and copy the group folder containing the song directories to the Songs folder, matching the structure above.\nNote: If the songs do not appear, be sure to check that you have not accidentally nested your folders too deep inside a redundant folder. Note: If a song is not contained inside a group folder, but instead on the root Songs directory, the game will stop loading to let you know of the Song folder in question. Configuring your controls Project OutFox supports a wide variety of controllers and even arcade hardware. To configure your button mappings, go to Options \u0026gt; Input \u0026amp; Calibration \u0026gt; Config Key/Joy Mappings.\nUse the arrow keys to select an item to map, press Enter, and then press the button on the keyboard or controller you want to use. You can have multiple button assignments for each command.\nEach game type has its own default keyboard configuration. For example, dance maps the first player to the arrow keys. (when playing on keyboard, this is often referred to as the \u0026ldquo;index\u0026rdquo; playstyle).\nController not working? If your controller does not perform as well or function as expected, you can switch to the alternate XInput input mode from Options \u0026gt; Experimental Settings.\nXInput will sometimes also require you to map your controller to the input engine\u0026rsquo;s virtual gamepad, allowing the game to properly interface with the device.\nThis menu can be found at Options \u0026gt; Input \u0026amp; Calibration \u0026gt; Map Controller.\nCalibrate your audio sync In a rhythm game, timing is everything. But latency produced by your audio outputs can affect your accuracy. If you feel like the game is not judging your timing accurately, you can interactively adjust the audio offset.\nOptions \u0026gt; Input \u0026amp; Calibration \u0026gt; Calibrate Audio Sync\nA song will play with a pattern of alternating notes; in the dance game type, they will be left and right arrows.\nTap the notes based on what you HEAR, not what you SEE. This calibration will repeat continuously. Every 24 notes, your inputs will be used to calculate a new offset. Once you feel the judgment has been set correctly, press the Back button (mapped to Escape by default). It will ask you for confirmation in setting the new offset.\nAlternatively, if you wish to automatically calibrate in-game while playing your song of choice, you can press F6 twice during gameplay to enable AutoSync Machine, which will last until the end of the song or when exited with the Back button. A message will appear asking to confirm your changes.\nAudio Latency / ASIO If something still feels off, you might be playing a gamemode with keysounds, which means the user\u0026rsquo;s button inputs will trigger a sound when pressed.\nExamples of keysounded gamemodes: kbm, po-mu, be-mu\nAudio latency is a massive problem for these game modes, because there will be a delay between the user\u0026rsquo;s button press and the sound that is played. Merely calibrating the judgment window will not improve latency.\nOn Windows, it is strongly recommended to use an ASIO driver to ensure lowest possible latency. Mac and Linux users should already obtain low latency output without any special configuration.\nIf you are only interested in dance mode, you can ignore this section. ASIO provides no particular benefit for non-keysounded modes, if you have calibrated correctly. Windows does not include any ASIO drivers, because these are dependent on your specific audio hardware. Do not enable this unless you have an ASIO driver present on your system. To enable the ASIO driver in Outfox, edit your Preferences.ini (located in the Save folder) and set SoundDrivers to asio, like so:\nSoundDrivers=asio\nRealtek ASIO If your computer uses Realtek-based audio hardware, there is a native implementation of ASIO made by Realtek.\nFirst, install the official Realtek audio driver (this is NOT the Windows built-in driver). This is usually available from your motherboard\u0026rsquo;s driver download page. Reboot your computer after installing this driver, and before installing the ASIO module.\nRealtek ASIO Driver\nFL Studio ASIO If your audio hardware does not have a native ASIO implementation, FL Studio provides a wrapper that can \u0026ldquo;simulate\u0026rdquo; ASIO support and achieve lower latency, however this is not ideal as it is not a proper native implementation.\nThe free demo of FL Studio includes FL Studio ASIO. All other optional components can be un-checked. Do note that this requires installation of the full FL Studio software.\nNo license is required to utilize FL Studio ASIO.\nFL Studio\nCreate a profile By default, OutFox saves data to a global \u0026ldquo;machine profile\u0026rdquo;. However, there is certain data that will not persist between sessions, such as high scores and player settings.\nYou can manage profiles from Options \u0026gt; Profiles. From here you can create a profile, and edit existing profiles.\nFrom the profile editor (highlight a profile and press Start, and then select \u0026ldquo;Edit profile\u0026rdquo;), you can input fitness-related information, change the layout of the optional \u0026ldquo;Detailed Stats\u0026rdquo; pane during gameplay, and add an avatar to your profile (avatars are loaded from the Appearance/Avatars directory).\nNext steps The only thing left to do is have fun!

This system is based off the spline system used in NotITG, which means it is usable alongside the pre-existing SM5 spline system and other modifiers, too.\nPoints are positioned like they are for Gradient modifiers, meaning in multiples of ARROW_SIZE away from the receptor.\nIn SM5, this is only accessible through the PlayerOptions functions, while NotITG has functions available in Player and also has modstring versions available (Though, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to use the lua functions instead.)\nPoint and column numbering start at 1 in SM5, while it starts at 0 in NotITG.\nTo stop the current chain of spline points, a \u0026rsquo;null point\u0026rsquo; (Where both position and magnitude are at zero) can be used as a \u0026rsquo;null terminator\u0026rsquo; or sorts. This is only applicable for points after the first.\nThe following types are avaiable for modsplines (designated as \u0026lt;axis\u0026gt;):\nX (Positioning on the x axis, affects receptors \u0026amp; notes. Works in multiples of ARROW_SIZE) Y (Positioning on the y axis, affects receptors \u0026amp; notes. Works in multiples of ARROW_SIZE. The quirks of SpiralY apply here if holds or rolls are involved.)

Known as \u0026ldquo;RotationX\u0026rdquo; in NotITG, but uses RotX for functions. Also affects hold heads in SM5 without extra mods needed.) RotY (Rotation on the y axis, affects notes only. Works in radians. Known as \u0026ldquo;RotationY\u0026rdquo; in NotITG, but uses RotY for functions. Also affects hold heads in SM5 without extra mods needed.) RotZ (Rotation on the z axis, affects notes only. Works in radians. Known as \u0026ldquo;RotationZ\u0026rdquo; in NotITG, but uses RotZ for functions.

OH NO! (I will get to this) Test your input, see if your keys are mapped and if so which ones. By pushing the buttons on the pad it’ll say something to the effect of “Key B 12 – Not Mapped” and if you step/press on the key and nothing shows up it’s not mapped, no big proceed to the next step to set it up.\nStep 2: The Easy Way So on to the good stuff; OutFox has a built in game-pad tool that will automatically take care of most of this for you\nYou push “Enter” on the keyboard and push the appropriate button on the dance pad/etc. to map the buttons to the button you want.\nI would recommend using this screen for most controllers on pc, it takes a lot of the guess work out of the whole thing. After setting this up repeat Step 1 if your keys show up as “Unmapped” that’s great go to the “Config Key/Joy Mappings” and do your thing, you’re done with the guide!\nIf it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026hellip;\nStep 3: The not super intuitive way (SDL2 Game-pad Tool) There is a nifty tool around called SDL2 Game-pad Tool. You connect your controller (via USB or Bluetooth or however you desire to connect your controller to the PC), and it’ll show up on the top drop down menu.\nClick \u0026ldquo;Create a New Mapping\u0026rdquo; Step/Press the input you want for those buttons much like you would on Step 2 of this procedure. Skip the rest. Save the Mapping String. Copy the Mapping String. Go to where you installed the game, and paste the string into Data/gamecontrollerdb.txt A note The “#” is useful for when you want to have different Mapping Strings for the same game-pad, it basically hides the mapping string from the program reading it. I made 3 different mapping for testing the the program would only recognize one, then I hid the mapping string with a hashtag (pound symbol for you oldies around) and the one not hidden was now seen by the program.\nBasically, don’t do multiple mapping strings on the same controller (even if you change the name); the program will work with one at a time and honestly one is all you need. You should be good to go and repeat Step 1 and then go to “Config Key/Joy Mappings” right after and set up your pad.\nStill isn\u0026rsquo;t working? This hasn’t quite happened to me (I tried with the PS3 DDR mat) but there are 2 types of controllers, a “Hat” type and not. So let’s say for example you hook up a pad/controller and the D-Pad you configured up down left and right but “Config Key/Joy Mappings” only allows you to push one of them and the rest don’t work.\nTry configuring the directions to the analog stick instead and then mapping them again. I don’t think you should have to but it works, I’ve tested this with my PS4 Controller and in fact you can play with analog input.\nXInput interfering with HIDAPI mode, and breaking axis pads If you have an axis pad which is showing two sets of buttons, or simply just cancelling out, and you cannot seem to map it in game, this is what you need to do to fix it. The pad showing two buttons will look like this:\nI am pressing the left Arrow, but getting two sets of inputs. On Linux and MacOS, this can be due to an installed xbox360 driver, or the x-pad module intercepting the events, and reporting an axis anyway. The next patch of OutFox mitigates this issue a little bit, but it still is a pain.\nTo fix this, you need to write down the BUTTON numbers shown on screen, so you get a list for all four arrows:\nDown=Joy1_Button 2 Left=Joy1_Button 1 Right=Joy1_Button 4 Up=Joy1_Button 3 Make sure that you close the game. You can now navigate to your save folder, and look for your key-maps.ini file and set the buttons manually, so you can basically ignore the axis values given by the x-pad driver. you need to add the mapping before the ::: as shown below:\nYou can save this, and then start the game again, and your pad will be mapped.\nDown=Joy1_Button 2 Left=Joy1_Button 1 Right=Joy1_Button 4 Up=Joy1_Button 3 Make sure that you close the game.

They are set up for 4 panel, so you can then remap them.\nOn some themes which only use the \u0026lsquo;Arcade\u0026rsquo; glyphs, (red/green/grey buttons) we have added these as well so you know which is which.\n","description":"On Alpha 4.5 and newer, we switched to using an XInput-compliant input system.\nDue to these changes, not all controllers (such as game-pads, dance pads, and other rhythm game-specific controllers) are guaranteed to function with OutFox out of the box (even if they were supported on earlier versions), unless a controller mapping profile has been created for that specific controller.\nWe would like to thank Josen Tiamat for writing these new instructions for how to configure your controllers for use on OutFox."},{"id":120,"href":"/user-guide/controllers/controller_mapping_drums/","title":"Drums Mapping","parent":"Controllers and Peripherals","content":" Madcatz Rock Band 4 Drum Kit (Playstation 4, Bluetooth) Madcatz Rock Band 4 Drum Kit (Playstation 4, Bluetooth) Outfox Joypad Button Physical Device Name po-mu Button 1 Blue Pad and Cym Right Yellow Button 2 Green Pad and Cym Right Green Button 3 Red Pad Red Button 4 Yellow Pad and Cym Right Blue Button 5 Right Pedal Button 6 Left Pedal ","description":" Madcatz Rock Band 4 Drum Kit (Playstation 4, Bluetooth) Madcatz Rock Band 4 Drum Kit (Playstation 4, Bluetooth) Outfox Joypad Button Physical Device Name po-mu Button 1 Blue Pad and Cym Right Yellow Button 2 Green Pad and Cym Right Green Button 3 Red Pad Red Button 4 Yellow Pad and Cym Right Blue Button 5 Right Pedal Button 6 Left Pedal "},{"id":121,"href":"/dev/mods/","title":"Guide to Modifiers","parent":"Developers and Creators","content":"Want your arrows to dance around to the music (as seen in Pump it Up PRO 2 and the StepMania/ITG Modfile Community)?\nWell, if you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of modifiers and attacks, this guide is for you!\nWhat are Mods/Attacks? Modifiers (or Mods) apply all kinds of effects to the notes in a song - they can make the notes scroll in different directions, bounce to the beat, and many, many more things!\nYou can manually turn on modifiers on any song by entering the player options menu (press start twice when you pick a song to play), and choosing Modifiers then Exit at the bottom. Mods in the Acceleration, Effects, Appearance, and Scroll categories work best for attacks - feel free to play around!\nAttacks are one of the easiest ways to add Modifiers to your simfile - Attacks will apply whatever mods you want at specific times you set in the song!\nFor StepMania 5/Outfox-based arcade cabinets (and SM5-based games like PIU Infinity), Attacks can even be used in USB custom songs and charts (if enabled)!\nAdding Attacks to a Simfile We\u0026rsquo;ll assume you\u0026rsquo;ve already created a simfile, and know a bit about how to use the editor here.\nFirst off:\nOpen a Simfile in the Outfox editor (Title Screen \u0026gt; Edit/Share \u0026gt; Edit Songs/Steps). Pick a song, then pick a difficulty (chart).\nWhen editing the chart, press Enter where you want the Modifier to start.\nChoose Modifiy attacks at current beat at the bottom of the menu.\nChoose Add Attack\nHere, you\u0026rsquo;ll enter a Modifier to get applied:\nMany modifiers from the Player Options menu will work (Beat, Drunk, etc), for now just type Beat and press Enter. Any attacks you add will show up to the right of the notes, both when editing and playing a simfile in the editor. Press P to play your song - you should see the attack you added scroll up the screen with the notes.\nWhen the attack with your Beat modifier scrolls to the top of the screen, the arrows will start bouncing to the beat! Editing/Removing Attacks Attacks only last a few seconds by default - to make it last longer you\u0026rsquo;ll need to edit the attack\u0026rsquo;s length.\nEdit an Attack In the editor, go to the beat where the Attack you want to edit is, and press Enter.\nAll Attacks on that beat are listed - pick the one you want to edit (arrow keys/enter).\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t see the attack you just added, make sure you\u0026rsquo;re lined up to the Exact time the Attack is at! From here, press Enter on any of these options to change them:\nStarting time: When this attack starts. It\u0026rsquo;s better to remove/re-add an attack if you want to change when it starts. Seconds Remaining: How long the attack lasts (defalt: 5 seconds) Attack 1: The mod you just added - press enter to change Add Mod: Pick this to add another mod to this attack Remove an Attack In the editor, go to the beat the Attack is on and press Enter.\nPick the attack you want to remove and press Enter.\nPick the Mod you want to remove and press Enter.\nWhen asked for a new Mod, backspace all the letters in the mod and press Enter.\nWhen all Mods in an attack are removed, the Attack is auto-removed. Mod Strength/Approach Rate Mod Strength Is Beat too wild? Not wild enough? You can fix that!\nTo change how strong a mod is, add a percentage before it, like 50% Beat\nBy default, any mods you add default to 100%. You can dial this down if you don\u0026rsquo;t want a mod to be as strong.\nPercentages above 100% are a-ok if you want really strong mods! Negative percentages like -50% Beat work too if you want to totally invert an effect (it might not be obvious on all mods, but it does work).\nFinally: No means the same thing as 0%. Say, if you have a Beat attack earlier in the song, you can turn it off with 0% Beat or No Beat - either works!\nThe difference between 50% Beat and 100% Beat\nIn the above video - Left = 40% Beat, Right = 125% Beat\nMod Approach Rate Want a mod to slowly fade in over time, or instantly go to max strength? You can change that too!\nTo change how fast/slow a mod is applied, add a * and a number before the mod, like *2 Beat\nHigher numbers apply mods faster, lower numbers (decimals included!) make mods apply slower.\n*0.5 = Half as fast, *2 = Twice as fast.\n(The default *1 applies at a rate of 100% of a mod over 1 second)\nMod approach rate can also combine with any strength, including 0%! If you want to get rid of a mod really fast, you can use an attack like *50 0% Beat.\nThe difference between *0.5 Beat and *10 Beat\nIn the above video - Left = *0.5 Beat (fades in half as fast), Right = *10 Beat (fades in 10x as fast!). They both get to the same strength at the end, but the left side takes longer to do so.\nResources/What\u0026rsquo;s Next Next up is to play around with Modifiers!

The later videos in the series dive really deep into how some mods behave!\nHow to set up Mods in Courses in also covered in earlier videos in the series (though again, focusing on older versions of StepMania) You can join Project Outfox\u0026rsquo;s Discord server for more help from the community - feel free to ask mods/attacks-related questions in channels like #mods-coding-help.\nMy Mods Don\u0026rsquo;t Work! Double check you\u0026rsquo;ve spelled your Mod name right - mods from older versions of the game (like OpenITG) may have different names in SM5/Outfox! You may get strange behavior if you add new attacks into a simfile before the last attack in the file. Mod Behaviors Across Different Themes Some mods you add (like Drunk, Tornado, Boomerang) may change behavior depending on the theme you\u0026rsquo;re currently using.\nIn older versions (like Stepmania 5.0/5.1), the theme\u0026rsquo;s internal resolution (HD vs non-HD themes, specifically SCREEN_HEIGHT) is used in calculations for certain mods. On these versions, these mods will behave differently on themes with different internal resolutions.\nIn Outfox, these calculations are performed based on a completely separate theme metric instead, ModifierHeight. If the theme changes this value, it will affect those calculations (and therefore mod behaviors, and is noted as doing so).\nPlan accordingly if you plan on playing your simfiles/chart edits on different versions/themes!\nOther Notes Mods obey stops and BPM changes in songs. If your song stops while a mod like Beat is in effect, the notes will freeze in the middle of Beat\u0026rsquo;s animation, skewed to the sides. Earlier versions of StepMania can round the time a mod starts at if you save and exit a simfile in the editor, making it harder/impossible to edit in the future.

The difficulty can range between \u0026ldquo;trivial to read\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;may as well memorize the chart\u0026rdquo;.\nOften called \u0026ldquo;Modfiles\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Modcharts\u0026rdquo;.\nThese usually use the FGCHANGES or BGCHANGES of a simfile to load the lua files (if any are used).\nDisclaimer: Make sure you\u0026rsquo;ve got making a chart down before starting to make modcharts! Good mods can\u0026rsquo;t save a bad chart!\nHow to Apply Modifiers There are a few ways to go about this, and it varys depending on what version of SM is being used.\nApplyGameCommand (SM3.95/oITG/nITG) ApplyGameCommand is a GameState function that provides a way to send modifiers among other commands. The first paramter is the command type followed by the parameters. (In this case, a modstring) The second parameter is what player to apply the command (1 = player 1). If not specified, it applies to all players.\nGAMESTATE:ApplyGameCommand(\u0026#34;mod, *0.5 420 beat\u0026#34;, 1) While it\u0026rsquo;s still available in SM5 (including OutFox), it\u0026rsquo;s not recommended because it applies mods to the \u0026ldquo;Preferred\u0026rdquo; ModsLevel, which means modifiers apply instantly (no transition), and they persist outside of the simfile. SM5.2 Doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have this function available.\n#MODS (Course files, SM3.95/oITG/nITG/SM5) Old modfiles used to require going into marathon mode to play the scripted modifiers. Unlike most things, this is time-based due to charts being able to have stops.\n#MODS:TIME=0.000:END=10.000:MODS=*0.5 420 beat; #MODS:TIME=5.000:LEN=1.600:MODS=*2 50 stealth; (ex: Beat starts at 0 seconds and ends at 10. Stealth turns on at 5 seconds and ends 1.6 seconds later)\nNowadays, this is considered obsolete in favor of lua-powered modifiers. It\u0026rsquo;s still usuable in SM5.\n#ATTACKS (Simfiles, nITG/SM5) Allows for the application of modifiers similar to what course files have. The syntax is exactly the same, just with MODS becoming ATTACKS.\n#ATTACKS:TIME=0.000:END=10.000:MODS=*0.5 420 beat; #ATTACKS:TIME=5.000:LEN=1.600:MODS=*2 50 stealth; nITG accepts #ATTACKS or #MODS inside the .sm file, while SM5 only accepts #ATTACKS in sm \u0026amp; ssc.\nThese do not load in course mode, however.\nApplyModifiers (nITG) A dedicated function for applying modifiers without needing the processing overhead and \u0026ldquo;mod, \u0026quot; that ApplyGameCommand does.\nGAMESTATE:ApplyModifiers(\u0026#34;*0.5 420 beat\u0026#34;, 1) Often used as a replacement for ApplyGameCommand in nITG modfiles.\nPlayerOptions functions (SM5) Every modifier has a setter function in PlayerOptions. This can be used in place of other functions. These are case-sensitive, though. If using strings, they\u0026rsquo;ll have to be parsed to make use of these functions.\nlocal po = {GAMESTATE:GetPlayerState(0):GetPlayerOptions(\u0026#39;ModsLevel_Song\u0026#39;), GAMESTATE:GetPlayerState(1):GetPlayerOptions(\u0026#39;ModsLevel_Song\u0026#39;)} po[1]:Beat(4.2, 0.5) SetPlayerOptions (SM5) This function works by resetting the PlayerOptions for the given level, and setting it according to the string.\nGAMESTATE:GetPlayerState(PLAYER_1):SetPlayerOptions(\u0026#39;ModsLevel_Song\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;*0.5 420 beat\u0026#39;) Because it resets PlayerOptions, it might not be so useful for applying scripted modifiers.\nFromString (SM5.1 and onwards) Like how ApplyModifiers is specifically for modstrings in nITG, FromString provides direct access to the string parser used for modifiers in ApplyGameCommand, and works very much like how ApplyGameCommand would.\nlocal po = {GAMESTATE:GetPlayerState(0):GetPlayerOptions(\u0026#39;ModsLevel_Song\u0026#39;), GAMESTATE:GetPlayerState(1):GetPlayerOptions(\u0026#39;ModsLevel_Song\u0026#39;)} po[1]:FromString(\u0026#34;*0.5 420 beat\u0026#34;) Def.PandaTemplate (Project OutFox Alpha V) Def.PandaTemplate is an Actor that provides an easy interface for adding eased mods as well as set mods. If you are familiar with the ease template, the Def.PandaTemplate Actor should be straightforward to use.\nlocal mods = { {0, 3, \u0026#39;*1 flip\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;len\u0026#39;} } local eases = { {4, 4, 0, 100, \u0026#39;drunk\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;len\u0026#39;, Tweens.easeInOutSine} } return Def.ActorFrame { Def.PandaTemplate { OnCommand = function(self) self:PopulateBeatMods(mods) self:PopulateEases(eases) self:sleep(math.huge) end, } } Modfile templates Starting to make a modfile can seem really daunting if one does not know how to begin. Luckilly, there are many templates out there to help with creating modfiles.\nOnes made for SM3.95 and Open/NotITG are usually done with .xml files, and some rare .lua files.\nOnes made for SM5 and Project OutFox are almost always .lua files.\nProject OutFox templates Sudospective\u0026rsquo;s Ichigo Template\nhttps://github.com/Sudospective/ichigo-template Allows easy creation of classes Fully compatible with the new tween system Uses the new Def.PandaTemplate modreader Object oriented Some parts similar to Kitsu, some similar to Mirin Sudospective\u0026rsquo;s Kitsu Template\nhttps://github.com/Tiny-Foxes/kitsu-template Up to date: fully supports Project OutFox Fully compatible with the new tween system Object oriented template Easy to find update loop MTK\u0026rsquo;s OutFox port of Exschwasion\u0026rsquo;s easing template\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1HfCFvTHZUI4dO_eAk4iN5mO3H61caHzE Lots of local variables used up in the main scope to preserve syntax.

There are new pages with more info about OutFox Serenity, check them out!\nSerenity User Profiles Serenity Volume Resume What is OutFox Serenity? OutFox Serenity is the official community song pack project made primarily for Project OutFox. Its purpose is to produce packs of \u0026ldquo;libre\u0026rdquo; songs for the game that can be freely redistributed (including as part of its default, bundled songs), and to showcase the functionality of Project Outfox by offering charts for multiple game types beyond just 4-key/dance.\nHow was OutFox Serenity created? During Project OutFox Alpha 4.8.0 development, we started to release many modes, however, some of those modes have complicated chart standards or no longer have support. We decided then that it was right to create a community pack based on StepMania StepMix where the community would contribute for songs to be bundled with the game, but this time, songs for every mode OutFox supports.\nHow can I contribute to OutFox Serenity? Make sure to read our guidelines to understand the rules of contribution and submission. Fill our online form selecting the option of which you want to submit and any other required information. If you have music that follows our Music guidelines, then please submit it using our online form, once you submit you have agreed that we have permission to store/share your content with members of our team to organize the selection of future volumes of OutFox Serenity and that the public has permission to Stream/Record and Upload Videos playing Project OutFox with your songs, our channel will upload your song to Project OutFox Youtube Channel and that your song can be featured in arcades, as long as your song is selected.\nWe will request you to use our templates which can be found on the Project OutFox Discord Server. Make sure to check the pinned messages as they include each game mode scaling.\nDoes OutFox Serenity work with other StepMania forks? No, the packages we provide include content which will not work with other StepMania forks and can even cause crashes when trying to load them.\nContributors and the Serenity Team prepare the pack with Project OutFox performance and behavior in mind, even if some individual chart works with those older forks.\nHow do I update my packs? When a new version comes out, we release multiple packages, usually it will be like this:\nAll in One, this package will include all content from all volumes X Volume Only, this package will include only the new volume and its content. (It WON\u0026rsquo;T include new content for older volumes that were produced during the development of the new volume) We recommend you to download the \u0026ldquo;All in One\u0026rdquo;, delete the content inside your local OutFox Serenity groups and replace with what is inside the new All in One package, this way you avoid losing scores (Unless the chart has been updated), the general idea is to keep everything with the same directory path. It is not recommened to just add an replace content this can introduce problems in the future.\nHow will Volume 3 work? Volume 3 will work very different from past volumes, but to make it simple:\nWe will reveal 3 songs with SSC Templates and that will be a season. Contributors can contribute with charts and graphics. After 3 month from the season reveal, we will release that season package and start development of the next season. Important:\nTTC (Time to Chart) for every season will be 3 months. There\u0026rsquo;s no Testing Weeks, make sure your content is final and meets all our requirements before sending. Each season will always have 3 songs at max. If a song has charts but no graphics yet, it will use the pack graphics, if after 2 months of the song reveal there\u0026rsquo;s still no graphic for that song, then it will be made by members of the Serenity Team. Can I Stream/Record and Upload Videos of me playing Serenity Songs or use them in a Arcade? Yes! In case you want to be extra secure, each song folder in our package includes a text file with licenses for the Song and Graphics. (If a section isn\u0026rsquo;t include for one of those, you can assume you\u0026rsquo;re safe.)\nWhat are OutFox Serenity Volumes? Volume 1 OutFox Serenity Volume I Released August 27, 2021, OutFox Serenity Volume I features music by Aspid Cat, Drazil, Jack5, Matduke, mmry, PizeroFox, Seo, and Sevish.

But make sure its gimmicks only work with your specific chart/difficulty, no chart should impact other\u0026rsquo;s charts in any way.\nI submitted music but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t featured on the next volume/season, why? Our team has a list of music submitted by members of the community, we try to select a safe amount of music that guarantees a healthy amount of charts will be made for each one since chart and graphic submissions are made purely by the interest of the authors and at the moment of writing this document, Project OutFox has no dedicated Chart Creation Team.\nAnother possible reason is that your submission does not follow the music guidelines, if you think that is the case then you can contact us using the following socials:\nDiscord Reddit (Post or Private Message any Mods) Project OutFox Forum (Create a post) Twitter (Private Message) Facebook (Private Message) Github (New Discussion) Make sure to check any of the socials you provided to us, if we are considering using your music but it\u0026rsquo;s missing something, we will try to contact you.\nWhy are some music files missing from the repository?

Keep in mind that this software currently is Windows only.\nThe Texture Font Generator\u0026rsquo;s more recent versions export glyphs that are only compatible with OutFox. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to use the tool to generate fonts for earlier StepMania releases, use the Legacy version of the tool. Open the program and a window will pop up with a font preview and selections.\nThe smaller window area provides info into what font to use, its size to render, and vertical spacing control buttons, these are tagged on the \u0026ldquo;Overlap\u0026rdquo; text area.\nMaximum size: indicates the size of each glyph.\nPadding: changes the vertical and horizontal spacing on each glyph.\nPage: is the glyph map to render out with the current font.\nIt is recommended to use a monospaced font for GUI elements, as it allows readability and accesibility for dyslexic individuals. The tool allows for different kinds of options on what glyphs to export, which are the following:\nExporting to only numbers, which are commonly used on scoring text (shown on screenshot above) Export strokes (a separate layer of fonts that can be used for bordering) Double Resolution (A flag added to the filename, which tells the engine to render the glyph half the size for sharper text, but it will need a bigger sized font for better results) When you\u0026rsquo;re ready to export the font, click on File \u0026gt; Save, and a prompt window will appear asking the location on where to save the file. You can give the font a name, and this will be applied to all of the files exported.

In NotITG, this is known as \u0026ldquo;granulate\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;grain\u0026rdquo; (alias).\nNegative values make the hold smoother (with a \u0026rsquo;limit\u0026rsquo; of -93.75% which results in a step size of 1 pixel), but could cost performance due to the extra calculations being done. Positive values make the hold look more polygonal (with no real limit). Very noticable on modifiers that work on position, like Drunk.\nCommon values can range from practically anywhere due to it being a multiplier. Try starting with -50% or 100% and go further if extra points or less points are desired.\nQuirks: In NotITG, this modifier works a bit differently. At 0%, the holds are drawn with the normal stepsize, but the magnitude when nonzero controls the step size in pixels (100% = step size of 1 pixel, 400% = step size of 4 pixels (normal in NotITG)).

The same notes from there apply here.\nAvailable variants (modstring): notepathgrainmult, arrowpathgranulate (NotITG name), arrowpathgrain (NotITG alias)\nPlayerOptions format: NotePathGrainMult(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modstring variant\u0026gt;\nNotePathWidth Desc: Allows for adjusting how wide the notepath is. It\u0026rsquo;s added onto the default, which is one pixel in theme-space.\nAt the moment, there is a GPU-enforced limit on the actual width. In NotITG, this can be worked around by turning off smoothlines (Which uses CPU-based quads, also has a side-effect of showing depth in the lines)\nAvailable variants (modstring): notepathwidth, arrowpathsize (NotITG name), arrowpathgirth (NotITG alias), arrowpathwidth (NotITG alias)\nPlayerOptions format: NotePathWidth(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modstring variant\u0026gt;\nNotePathDrawSize Desc: Where DrawSize affects the notefield\u0026rsquo;s rendering space, this affects the rendering space of NotePath. This is unaffected by normal DrawSize, but the rendering space starts out the same as a whole notefield.\nAvailable variants: NotePathDrawSize (Affects area below the receptors), NotePathDrawSizeBack (Affects area above the receptors)\nAvailable variants (modstring): notepathdrawsize, notepathdrawsizeback, arrowpathdrawsize (NotITG name for notepathdrawsize), arrowpathdrawsizefront (NotITG alias for notepathdrawsize), arrowpathdrawdistance (NotITG alias for notepathdrawsize), arrowpathdrawdistancefront (NotITG alias for notepathdrawsize), arrowpathdrawsizeback (NotITG name for notepathdrawsizeback), arrowpathdrawdistanceback (NotITG alias for notepathdrawsizeback)\nPlayerOptions format: \u0026lt;NotePathDrawSize variant\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modstring variant\u0026gt;\nModTimer Desc: Allows one to set the timer used by many modifiers.\nThese are the following types (denoted as \u0026lt;type\u0026gt;):\n\u0026lsquo;ModTimerType_Default\u0026rsquo; just go with the game\u0026rsquo;s default timer type (5.2 defaults to song, 5.1 \u0026amp; OutFox default to game) \u0026lsquo;ModTimerType_Game\u0026rsquo; (Use the game\u0026rsquo;s current uptime in seconds.) \u0026lsquo;ModTimerType_Song\u0026rsquo; (Use the song\u0026rsquo;s current time in seconds.) \u0026lsquo;ModTimerType_Beat\u0026rsquo; (Use the song\u0026rsquo;s current beat.) Often, song time is used as the setting.\nQuirks: In NotITG, this is done by a single name (\u0026ldquo;modtimer\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;timer\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;globalmodtimer\u0026rdquo;) with magnitudes. 0% = game time, 100% = song time, 200% = song beat.\nAvailable variants (modstring): modtimerdefault, modtimergame, modtimersong, modtimerbeat\nPlayerOptions format: ModTimerSetting(\u0026lt;type\u0026gt;)\nExample: ModTimerSetting('ModTimerType_Beat')\nModstring format: \u0026lt;modstring variant\u0026gt;\nExample: modtimerbeat\nAvailable sub modifiers:\nModTimerMult Desc: Add a multiplier onto the timer used for modifiers. 100% = 2x, -50% = 0.5x.\nAvailable variants (modstring): modtimermult, timermult (NotITG alias), globalmodtimermult (NotITG alias)\nPlayerOptions format: ModTimerMult(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modstring variant\u0026gt;\nModTimerOffset Desc: Offset the timer used for modifiers. 100% = 1 time unit.\nAvailable variants (modstring): modtimeroffset, timeroffset (NotITG alias), globalmodtimeroffset (NotITG alias)\nPlayerOptions format: ModTimerOffset(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modstring variant\u0026gt;\nNoteSkew Desc: Applies skew on the notes and receptors. Does not affect holds. Comes in skewx \u0026amp; skewy variants, and is also column-specific. NotITG calls the skewx variant \u0026ldquo;noteskew\u0026rdquo; because they originally only had skewx.\nCommon values range from -200 to 200%\nQuirks: N/A\nAvailable variants: NoteSkewX, NoteSkewY\nColumn-specific variants: NoteSkewXCol, NoteSkewYCol\nAvailable variants (modstring): noteskewx, noteskewx\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, noteskew (NotITG name), noteskew\u0026lt;column\u0026gt; (NotITG name), noteskewy, noteskewy\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;\nPlayerOptions format: \u0026lt;NoteSkew variant\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;) Example: NoteSkewX(0.7, 4)\nColumn-specific format: \u0026lt;NoteSkewCol variant\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: NoteSkewXCol(1, 0.25, 0.25, true):NoteSkewXCol(2, 0.5, 0.5, true):NoteSkewXCol(3, 0.75, 0.75, true):NoteSkewXCol(4, 1, 1)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modstring variant\u0026gt;\nExample: *4 70% noteskewx *0.25 25% noteskewx1, *0.5 50% noteskewx2, *0.75 75% noteskewx3, *1 100% noteskewx4\nNoteSkewX video example\nAvailable sub modifiers: noteskewtype (NotITG only) Desc: When active, the note skews get rotated (but not the receptors). In SM5, this can be often (mostly) replicated in dance by using the negative amount of NoteSkewY on columns 1 and 4.\nAvailable variants (modstring): noteskewtype, skewtype (alias)\nModstring format: \u0026lt;enable\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modstring variant\u0026gt;\nTrigClip Desc: Performs clipping on the trigonometric waves used in many modifiers and their variants.\nThe following are available:\nSinClip (sine wave clipping. Affects Wave (all non-tan variants), SpiralY, Bumpy (all non-tan variants), Beat (all variants), Zigzag (All variants), Digital (All non-tan variants), Bounce (All variants), Blink (All variants), Pulse (all non-tan variants), CosClip (cosine wave clipping. Affects Tornado (all non-tan varians), Tipsy (all non-tan variants), Expand, Drunk (all non-tan variants), SpiralX TanClip (tangent wave clipping, use values close to 100% for visible effects. Affects all tangent variants of all modifiers) Quirks: Going beyond 100% may result in interesting effects on some modifiers. In NotITG, this was \u0026lsquo;fixed\u0026rsquo;.\nCommon values range from 50 to 100%\nPlayerOptions format: \u0026lt;TrigClip variant\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: CosClip(0.5, 0.5)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modstring variant\u0026gt;\nExample: *0.5 50% cosclip\nCosClip video example\nDisableMines Desc: When active, stepping on mines will not have any effect. Useful if you want to place mines for aesthetic purposes, but don\u0026rsquo;t want to penalize players for ghost-tapping.\nQuirks: N/A\nPlayerOptions format: DisableMines(\u0026lt;enable\u0026gt;)\nExample: DisableMines(true)\nModstring format: \u0026lt;enable\u0026gt; disablemines\nExample: disablemines\nZBuffer Desc: When active, the zbuffer gets enabled regardless of modifiers active. Can act as an alternate way to enable zbuffer instead of using low amounts of z position modifiers. NotITG also allows having negative values to force it off. When the zbuffer is enabled, holds draw at a step size of 4 instead of 16. Also has \u0026ldquo;ztest\u0026rdquo; as an alias in NotITG.\nQuirks: N/A\nPlayerOptions format: ZBuffer(\u0026lt;enable\u0026gt;)\nExample: ZBuffer(true)\nModstring format: \u0026lt;enable\u0026gt; zbuffer\nExample: zbuffer\nCosecant Desc: When active, all tangent modifiers use a cosecant wave instead of a tangent wave, mimicking how NotITG v1 did tangent wave modifiers. Known as \u0026ldquo;cosec\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;glitchytan\u0026rdquo; (alias) in NotITG.\nQuirks: N/A\nPlayerOptions format: Cosecant(\u0026lt;enable\u0026gt;)\nExample: Cosecant(true)\nModstring format: \u0026lt;enable\u0026gt; cosecant\nExample: cosecant\nCosecant video example\nWireFrame Desc: A Column-specific modifier that allows setting the column to use wireframe mode for notes and holds. NotITG has a modstring alias that hits all columns.\nQuirks: Using a 3D noteskin is recommended if using this modifier.\nAvailable variants (modstring): wireframe\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, wireframe (NotITG alias that hits all columns)\nPlayerOptions format: WireFrameCol(\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;enable\u0026gt;)\nExample: WireFrameCol(2, true)\nModstring format: \u0026lt;enable\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modstring variant\u0026gt;\nExample: wireframe2\nWireFrame video example\nAvailable sub modifiers: WireFrameWidth Desc: Like how NotePath has a width sub modifier, this affects the width of the wireframe lines.\nAvailable variants (modstring): wireframewidth\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, wireframegirth\u0026lt;column\u0026gt; (NotITG alias), wireframewidth (NotITG alias that hits all columns), wireframegirth (NotITG alias that hits all columns)\nPlayerOptions format: WireFrameWidthCol(\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modstring variant\u0026gt;\nNoteSkin Desc: Get and set the NoteSkin for the player.\nQuirks: Returns both the previous name \u0026amp; if the set succeeded upon being given a string. Cannot be used to change noteskins mid-song (If forcing a noteskin, you have to reload the screen) like what OpenITG/SM3.95/NotITG has.\nPlayerOptions format: NoteSkin(\u0026lt;noteskin name\u0026gt;)\nExample: NoteSkin('Metal')\nModstring format: \u0026lt;noteskin name\u0026gt;\nExample: metal\nNoteSkinCol Desc: Allow getting and setting the noteskin on a column-basis. Unlike NoteSkin, this allows for changing the noteskin mid-song.\nWhen used on a single column, the receptors will not change.\nWhen \u0026lt;column\u0026gt; is nil, all columns will use the requested noteskin, and the receptors will change to match.\nQuirks: Requires a Preferences.ini for the song that lists the noteskins to load. May not play nice when the noteskin isn\u0026rsquo;t loaded. NOTESKIN:DoesNoteSkinExist could be used to ensure the noteskin exists before setting. The change is instant unlike noteskin changes done through attacks in OpenITG/SM3.95/NotITG.\nPlayerOptions format: NoteSkinCol(\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;noteskin name\u0026gt;)\nExample: NoteSkinCol(nil, 'lambda')\nModstring format: \u0026lt;noteskin name\u0026gt; noteskin\u0026lt;column\u0026gt; (ommitting column will hit all columns)\nExample: lambda noteskin\nNoteSkinCol video example\nLifeSetting Desc: Set the lifebar type to be used. There are three types (denoted as \u0026lt;type\u0026gt;):\nBar (The normal lifebar most people are used to.) Modstring form is \u0026ldquo;bar\u0026rdquo;. Battery (Mess up a certain number of times and you fail the song) Modstring form is \u0026ldquo;battery\u0026rdquo;. Time (You have a limited amount of time to live. Hit notes better to gain time.) Modstring form is \u0026ldquo;lifetime\u0026rdquo;. Quirks: This cannot be set during gameplay. It must be set before entering ScreenGameplay.\nPlayerOptions format: LifeSetting(\u0026lsquo;LifeType_\u0026lt;type\u0026gt;\u0026rsquo;)\nExample: LifeSetting('LifeType_Time')\nModstring format: \u0026lt;type\u0026gt;\nExample: lifetime\nDrainSetting Desc: Set how the lifebar\u0026rsquo;s health behavior works. There are three drain types (denoted as \u0026lt;type\u0026gt;):\nNormal (The health goes up and down at the expected rate.) Modstring form is \u0026ldquo;normal-drain\u0026rdquo;. NoRecover (The health only goes down.) Modstring form is \u0026ldquo;norecover\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;power-drop\u0026rdquo;. SuddenDeath (Getting any judgment below the required one will instantly kill you.) Modstring form is \u0026ldquo;suddendeath\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;death\u0026rdquo;. Quirks: Initial health will start at 100% when not using Normal drain. Initial health for Normal is a theme metric, as well as the minimum judgment for SuddenDeath. This also works mid-gameplay, allowing for sections that require good accuracy.\nPlayerOptions format: DrainSetting(\u0026lsquo;DrainType_\u0026lt;type\u0026gt;\u0026rsquo;)\nExample: DrainSetting('DrainType_NoRecover')\nModstring format: \u0026lt;type\u0026gt;\nExample: norecover\nBatteryLives Desc: Set how many lives are available in the Battery life bar at the start. Probably shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be set mid-gameplay.\nQuirks: N/A\nPlayerOptions format: BatteryLives(\u0026lt;number of lives\u0026gt;)\nExample: BatteryLives(5)\nModstring format: \u0026lt;number of lives divided by 100\u0026gt; lives\nExample: 0.05% lives\nRandAttack Desc: When active, random attacks will be launched throughout the song. Any nonzero magnitude will activate it. Cannot be set through modstrings.\nQuirks: The attacks chosen come from /Data/RandomAttacks.txt\nPlayerOptions format: RandAttack(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: RandAttack(1,1)\nNoAttack Desc: When active, RandAttack is canceled out. Any nonzero magnitude will activate it. Cannot be activated through modstrings.\nQuirks: N/A\nPlayerOptions format: NoAttack(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: NoAttack(1,1)\nPlayerAutoPlay Desc: When active, AutoPlay will be set on the player. Cannot be set through modstrings.\nQuirks: Do not set this during gameplay. Attempting to enable it will result in no input for the player and no autoplay, which will result in a stage fail.\nPlayerOptions format: PlayerAutoPlay(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: PlayerAutoPlay(1, 1)\nPassmark Desc: Set what life amount is required to pass a stage. Cannot be set through modstrings.\nQuirks: N/A\nPlayerOptions format: Passmark(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: Passmark(0.5, 2)\nMuteOnError Desc: When active, keysounds will not play upon errors (letting go hold notes and/or missing).\nQuirks: N/A\nPlayerOptions format: MuteOnError(\u0026lt;enable\u0026gt;)\nExample: MuteOnError(true)\nModstring format: \u0026lt;enable\u0026gt; muteonerror\nExample: muteonerror\nFailSetting Desc: Set how failing a song works. There are four drain types (denoted as \u0026lt;type\u0026gt;):\nImmediate (Song ends the moment you fail) Modstring forms are \u0026ldquo;failimmediate\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;failarcade\u0026rdquo;. ImmediateContinue (Song continues after failure, but you still fail at the end) Modstring forms are \u0026ldquo;failendofsong\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;failimmediatecontinue\u0026rdquo;. EndOfSong (Failure status is determined at the end of the song) Modstring form is \u0026ldquo;failatend\u0026rdquo;. Off (You cannot fail.) Modstring form is \u0026ldquo;failoff\u0026rdquo;. The default can be set in modstrings through \u0026ldquo;faildefault\u0026rdquo;\nQuirks: N/A\nPlayerOptions format: FailSetting(\u0026lsquo;FailType_\u0026lt;type\u0026gt;\u0026rsquo;)\nExample: FailSetting('FailType_Off')\nModstring format: \u0026lt;type\u0026gt;\nExample: failoff\n","description":"These modifiers don\u0026rsquo;t really fit into any of the above categories, so they\u0026rsquo;re here instead.\n\u0026ldquo;clearall\u0026rdquo; Desc: Tells PlayerOptions to do a reset. Often used in modfiles to mimic crs-style resetting. Only available in modstring form right now.\nQuirks: N/A\nModstring format: clearall\nHoldGrainMult Desc: Adds a multiplier to the \u0026lsquo;step size\u0026rsquo; of holds, allowing one to control how \u0026lsquo;granular\u0026rsquo; a hold is. In NotITG, this is known as \u0026ldquo;granulate\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;grain\u0026rdquo; (alias)."},{"id":131,"href":"/dev/theming/Theming-Scripts/","title":"Scripts","parent":"Introduction to theming","content":"Introduced in StepMania 3.95, Scripts are Lua files that are loaded globally to the engine.

Reading this might help you.\nWhere are language files stored Inside every theme, there\u0026rsquo;ll be a Languages folder. Inside that folder is where language files are stored. Example:\nLanguages/ en.ini ja.ini Here we can see 2 language files: en for English and ja for Japanese. It\u0026rsquo;s a standard to name language files in that format (language-COUNTRY.ini). For example: In this case, there\u0026rsquo;s a Portuguese translation, but since there\u0026rsquo;s also Portuguese from Portugal, the file was named pt-BR (BR = Brazil).\nFallback You probably already noticed a _fallback theme in the themes folder, but in case you didn\u0026rsquo;t: it\u0026rsquo;s where things that are necessary for every theme gets stored, so when someone is making a theme the game doesn\u0026rsquo;t blow up. The same goes for Languages: it\u0026rsquo;s important to also translate the fallback for your language because the theme you\u0026rsquo;re translating might not have every string that it uses on its folder.\nStarting a translation To start your work, create a new file for your language(-COUNTRY, if needed), and don\u0026rsquo;t forget to use the .ini extension. You can do this on Notepad with no problem but it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to use an editor like Visual Studio Code or Notepad++.\nNow open en.ini and your new language file, then copy all the content from en.ini to your language file. You can close en.ini now.\nLanguage file name standard The language code used for your language file should follow ISO-1 Language codes, while the COUNTRY CODE should follow ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 code.\n⚠️ StepMania Engine doesn\u0026rsquo;t have proper support for more than 2 letters language files: Both StepMania and OutFox, as the date of writting this document, do not follow ISO-1 and ISO 3166-1 standards, however, new languages should not abide by non-standards of StepMania Engine quirks. Your language will still be able to be selected and used, however, instead of showing the Language name, it will show the language code and users won\u0026rsquo;t have the game auto-select the language for them. This will later be fixed at least for OutFox, following this issue.\nWhat you should translate This is a code example taken from the Soundwaves theme.\n[Common] WindowTitle=Project OutFox StepMania=Project OutFox # Dedicated Character Display strings ModelLoadError=Model for %s (%s) Has a invalid model. Please check if the model.txt file is correctly named and formatted. ModelAnimLoadError=An animation file for %s\u0026#39;s model (%s) is invalid or non-existant. Please check the animation folders and see if there\u0026#39;s any file missing. LocationLoadError=Current Location (%s) is missing its location model. Please check if the model.txt file is correctly named and formatted. SongLoaderSingleSong=Random Song Play: Current Folder only contains 1 song. OutFox might get confused when picking the song via random. Selecting to index 1. SongLoaderNoSongs=Random Song Play: No songs were found in your OutFox install folder! Switching back to fallback music. Do not translate WindowTitle or StepMania keys. Do not translate the name \u0026ldquo;Project OutFox\u0026rdquo;.\nYou can see on this image and your file that every line has a Title=Value, and that\u0026rsquo;s how translation works on OutFox, you need to translate the value of the titles and you\u0026rsquo;re done. The theme does all the work of what string it should use.\nNow, you can\u0026rsquo;t just translate everything that you see. On ModelLoadError for example, there\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;%s\u0026rdquo; that means the theme or the game will put a string replacing that %s.\nAn example of that can be seen on the string %d Song Played that you\u0026rsquo;ll see on the next image.\n[Screen] HelpText=\u0026amp;BACK; Exit \u0026amp;START; Select \u0026amp;SELECT; Options \u0026amp;MENULEFT;\u0026amp;MENURIGHT;\u0026amp;MENUUP;\u0026amp;MENUDOWN; Move [ScreenWithMenuElements] HelpText=\u0026amp;BACK; Exit \u0026amp;START; Select \u0026amp;MENULEFT;\u0026amp;MENURIGHT; Move StageCounter=%s Stage EventStageCounter=Song %i You\u0026rsquo;ll also see lines like \u0026amp;START;, \u0026amp;SELECT; etc. They\u0026rsquo;re buttons that will be replaced once the game draws that string. Let\u0026rsquo;s see one of those strings in action?\n[ScreenSelectProfile] SingularSongPlayed=%d Song Played SeveralSongsPlayed=%d Songs Played PressStart=Press \u0026amp;START; to join. Here we can see that \u0026amp;START; gets replaced by a green square that represents the start button, and %d gets replaced by a number that\u0026rsquo;s how many songs that profile played.\nAnother special string is \\n. It creates a line break. For example, First Line\\nSecondLine would result in:\nFirst Line\nSecond Line\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example in action from _fallback/en.ini:\nText Context You might also want to translate the theme in a way that someone who has never played before will understand, instead of expecting everyone to already know what everything is. A new player might not understand what \u0026ldquo;holds\u0026rdquo; means if that word is translated to your language, but if it was kept as \u0026ldquo;holds\u0026rdquo; the user would know that it\u0026rsquo;s the literal name of the thing and not something that should make sense in your language.\nAnother hard example is steps: in OutFox, there are 2 kinds of steps. The ones that you press in gameplay and the steps of the chart made by the author (easy steps, hard steps\u0026hellip;). In English, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to only say steps because it makes sense for both, but that isn\u0026rsquo;t the case with every language. That\u0026rsquo;s why it was decided to keep it named \u0026ldquo;steps\u0026rdquo; for the pt-BR translation of Soundwaves, for example.\nCommunity Translations for Soundwaves (OutFox default until Alpha V) Many folks are already helping translate the new Soundwaves theme for various languages. As requested by one of our translators, we\u0026rsquo;ll mention those projects below to give them some visibility and encourage more people to join and help.\n° Polish - Done by Moneko\n° Japanese - Done by はぬべき(hanubeki)\n° Portuguese-Brazilian - Done by zerinho6, SHRMP0 and SheepyChris\n° German - Done by DanielRotwind\n° Hebrew - Done by Snil4\n° French - Done by Ksempac and Kaede573\n° Español - Done by JoseVarelaP\n° Hungarian - Done by KaZo75\n° Italian - Done by Gabrimax\n° Simplified Chinese - Done by jerrymyx\n° Slovak - Done by jose1711\nTools and Practices Translating can be tedious. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s hard to locate \u0026amp; remove lines that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be there or find missing ones. Because of that, translators themselves create tools to make our job easier and faster.\nTranslation Toolkit Translation Toolkit is a tool made by Ksempac to help remove lines that are not needed anymore, warn about lines that are missing, check your progress, etc. It supports Linux, Mac, and Windows.\nThis project is intended as a small application to automate some tasks for translators.\nIt is able to parse, analyze and fix the OutFox translation files.\nStepmania-TranslatorViewMaker Stepmania-TranslatorViewMaker is a tool made by Snil4. It supports any OS that has Python 3 installed.\nHave you ever tried to translate a program like OutFox and wondered \u0026ldquo;Hmm, now where can I find that line in the .ini?\u0026rdquo; Now there\u0026rsquo;s no need to wonder! This program will make a translator view file for your translation .ini and make your translation job easier.\nfini fini is a tool made by moruzerinho6\nAdds a extra build process where you can additional features that are not available on default ini file. Use:\n\u0026ldquo;Fini-\u0026rdquo; lines that allow you to specify another file to load it and expert a section/line/value from it. You can separate whole screens to specific files and only merger then together when building. You can make many lines depend on a specific file line, meaning you\u0026rsquo;ll later only need to change that file and effect many others. RTL variable to reverse the text only after you build the files. Any valid ini file is supported, meaning you don\u0026rsquo;t have to remake all your previous work Best practices Be constant with your words When doing a mention of \u0026ldquo;Steps\u0026rdquo;, ask yourself: is it clear which \u0026ldquo;type of Steps\u0026rdquo; you\u0026rsquo;re referring to? We have the following \u0026ldquo;types of steps\u0026rdquo;:\nSteps, which means the notes inside of the chart or the note count. StepDifficulty, which means the difficulty selected of the chart, such as Novice, Expert, Hard. Step, which means the action of stepping in the pad or a single note. StepType, which means the quantization (timing/color) of the note (e.g. 4th = red, an entire beat; 8th = blue, half a beat; etc). Soundwaves does not have this issue as it says \u0026ldquo;Taps\u0026rdquo; instead of Steps and directly says the difficulty.\nReload translations Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re editing the Soundwaves ScreenCaution and want to see how the translated string looks. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to restart the entire game to see the changes, here\u0026rsquo;s what you should do instead: Exit the screen you just translated, reload the metrics (Shift + Insert; or Shift + F2 on older alpha versions) and enter the screen again.\nSome themes might have a problem where not all strings are updated when metrics are reloaded due to how they are made. In that case, unfortunately, the only option is to restart the game.\nOutFox Releases Now that you have translated the latest alpha, you need to send it to OutFox somehow. This tutorial explains how you can do it!\nThe first thing to keep in mind is that each OutFox translation is hosted inside Tiny-Foxes to easily maintain and keep track of updates, so contact Team Rizu through any of their available social media profiles to get invited into Tiny-Foxes.\nIt is also required to know how git and Github work.\nThe exact steps are:\nCreate a Github account Download and learn basic git commands such as (git status, git push, git pull, git commit and git checkout) Learn how GitHub organization works. Having an editor such as Visual Studio Code will make git interactions way easier as those commands are available by the interface.\nRepository OutFox translation repositories adhere to a standard style. The repository title should be:\n\u0026ldquo;OutFox-[languageFileName[-COUNTRY]]\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026quot;-COUNTRY\u0026quot; should only be added in special cases (example: there\u0026rsquo;s Portuguese from Portugal and Brazilian Portuguese, so the Portuguese-Brazilian language file is \u0026ldquo;pt-BR.ini\u0026rdquo;).\nThe description of the repository should be:\n\u0026ldquo;[Language Name] ([languageFileName]) Translation for Project OutFox\u0026rdquo;\u0026quot;\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example:\nOutFox-ja Japanese (ja) Translation for Project OutFox Repository Format The repository should have 2 folders: \u0026ldquo;_fallback\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo;. Inside the _fallback will be the _fallback translation and default translation inside the default folder.\nOnly the translation file is required to be inside the folders/repository.\nKeep track It\u0026rsquo;s recommended that you include the version that the translation is targeting inside the files. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n# Version: 4.9.7 Alpha [Common] WindowTitle=Project OutFox StepMania=OutFox Submitting to OutFox So you finished the translation for this alpha before the release? You can then commit directly to master OR make a Pull Request with your files to OutFox-Translations so Jose_Varela includes them in the next alpha release.\nThis all assumes that you\u0026rsquo;re already a member of Tiny-Foxes and the translator team.\nWebmasters Project Webmasters is an internal OutFox initiative to translate OutFox Website. Being a webmaster means:\nPartial access to the website backend to implement your translation files; Closer contact with the OutFox Community team for quick updates and help; Having a special role in our Discord Server. The requirements to join Webmasters are having previous experience as a long-term OutFox translator, being a Discord Server member, and receiving a special invitation from the OutFox Team.\nWritten and Maintained by Moru Zerinho6\n","description":"Are you translating a theme to another language?

Understanding Press Events When calling an input, you have event.type, which is the moment where the button has been pressed, and contains three states:\ngraph TB A[\"InputEventType_FirstPress\n(When pressing the button for the first time)\"]:::Transition --\u003e B[\"InputEventType_Repeat\n(When holding the button)\"]:::Transition --\u003e C[\"InputEventType_Release\n(When lifting the button from being pressed)\"]:::Transition; The repeat rate for InputEventType_Repeat is dependant on the current screen\u0026rsquo;s RepeatRate metric, which determines how fast the input will be repeated every second. In order to filter what kind of input you want for specific actions, just include them in a if conditional check.\n-- Let\u0026#39;s say I want my start press to increase a variable and report it, -- but also increase it while holding the button, but not when lifting it. -- Initialize the variable to use as the counter. local count = 0 local function myCustomInput(event) -- In this case, we\u0026#39;ll check that the input is NOT Release, because that\u0026#39;s the only InputEventType -- that we don\u0026#39;t want verified on this check. if event.type ~= \u0026#34;InputEventType_Release\u0026#34; then -- Ok, we have pressed the button. time to count and report! if event.GameButton == \u0026#34;Start\u0026#34; then count = count + 1 SCREENMAN:SystemMessage(\u0026#34;The counter is now \u0026#34;.. count) end end end -- Now let\u0026#39;s load the function to the actorframe. return Def.ActorFrame{ OnCommand = function(self) SCREENMAN:GetTopScreen():AddInputCallback( myCustomInput ) end } Mouse Input Mouse input is supported on OutFox and earlier releases of SM5 via a MessageCommand system that determines which button was pressed to perform actions.\nMessage Name Segment of Mouse MouseLeftClick Left Mouse Click MouseRightClick Right Mouse Click MouseMiddleClick Middle Mouse Click MouseThumb1 Additional Mouse Click 1 MouseThumb2 Additional Mouse Click 2 MouseWheelUp Mouse Wheel Up MouseWheelDown Mouse Wheel Down -- Example script to show a message when the left click of the mouse is pressed.

Anything before or after is - 1 / + 1 respectively. itemIndex (number): The index of the current item to the entire list of items. numItems (number): The total amount of items currently available. For this example, let\u0026rsquo;s make a vertical scroller. When we say vertical, we mean that we want each item to scroll through the Y axis.

These two values return a value of -1 to 1. By having these two values in sync with each other, we\u0026rsquo;re effectively creating a circunference, which in turns provides us with a circle.\nSubdivisions You may have noticed that while scrolling with this, it won\u0026rsquo;t scroll like a circle, and that\u0026rsquo;s because there aren\u0026rsquo;t that many items to scroll through to provide the motion. You could either add more items to fulfill the item criteria or use Subdivisions.\nThe general (very summarized) rule with subdivisions on the actor scroller is that it adds N amount of items in-between existing items to provide a smoother scroll when using functions.\nSubdivisions = 2 --[[ Item 1 -- -- Item 2 -- -- Item 3 ]] Example with full code ↕ local af = Def.ActorFrame{ InitCommand=function(self) self:Center() end } local function generateItemsForScroller() -- When using the children attribute, the result of the function must -- be wrapped in an ActorFrame, which in this case is t. local t = Def.ActorFrame{} for i = 1,20 do t[#t+1] = Def.ActorFrame{ Def.BitmapText{ Font=\"_eurostile normal\", Text=\"I am Item \".. i, } } end return t end af[#af+1] = Def.ActorScroller{ NumItemsToDraw = 20, SecondsPerItem = 0.2, Subdivisions = 4, WrapScroller = true, LoopScroller = true, OnCommand=function(self) self:SetFastCatchup(true) -- For more information about this Input Controller, check \"Custom Input\". -- https://outfox.wiki/dev/theming/Theming-Custom-Input/ self.controller = LoadModule(\"Lua.InputSystem.lua\")(self) SCREENMAN:GetTopScreen():AddInputCallback(self.controller) end, OffCommand=function(self) SCREENMAN:GetTopScreen():RemoveInputCallback(self.controller) end, TransformFunction=function(self, offset, itemIndex, numItems) self:xy( math.cos(offset) * 150, math.sin(offset) * 150 ) -- Let's mark the current choice with the color green. if offset == 0 then self:diffuse(Color.Green) else self:diffuse(Color.Orange) end -- You can also interpret that if statement with a ternary method. -- self:diffuse( offset == 0 and Color.Green or Color.Orange ) end, children = generateItemsForScroller(), -- Let's add input to this scroller. MenuLeftCommand=function(self) self:SetDestinationItem( self:GetCurrentItem() - 1 ) end, MenuRightCommand=function(self) self:SetDestinationItem( self:GetCurrentItem() + 1 ) end } return af Functions PositionItems Forces all items to position themselves back into position. Useful if you happen to encounter a situation where the scroller doesn\u0026rsquo;t end exactly on the item you\u0026rsquo;ve selected.\nSetTransformFromFunction (function transformFunction)\nThe equivalent of the TransformFunction provided on the Attributes list. Allows you to add a new function in runtime, such as for example, converting the list from a vertical one to a horizontal one once the user has selected something.\nSetTransformFromHeight (number itemHeight)\nAn alias for SetTransformFromFunction that will convert the scroller to a vertical one.\nSetTransformFromWidth (number itemWidth)\nAn alias for SetTransformFromFunction that will convert the scroller to a horizontal one.\nSetCurrentAndDestinationItem (number index)\nTells the ActorScroller to set both Current and Destination to index. This can be useful if you want to move to the option index instantly.\nSetDestinationItem (number index)\nTells the scroller to move to index for its destination.\nGetSecondsToDestination Gives you a number indicating how long it will take before reaching the destination, which is the newly selected item.\nSetSecondsPerItem (number seconds)\nChanges the scroll length for each item.\nSetSecondsPauseBetweenItems (number seconds)\nChanges how long the scroller must wait while scrolling through an item.\nGetSecondsPauseBetweenItems Gets the amount of time the scroller must wait while scrolling through an item.\nSetPauseCountdownSeconds (number state)\nSet the amount of time to wait fully when pressing a button. This value works alongside SetSecondsPauseBetweenItems to calculate a pause time.\nSetNumSubdivisions (number numDivisions)\nSets the amount of Subdivisions for the scroller.\nScrollThroughAllItems Forces the scroll to scroll through all of the items present.\nScrollWithPadding (number beforeItems, number afterItems)\nMakes the scroller move automatically with a number of empty items to add at the start and end. You can use this to create credit sequences.\nSetFastCatchup (bool state)\nAccelerates the amount of time it takes to go from an item to another if it\u0026rsquo;s more than 1.\nFor example, let\u0026rsquo;s say you\u0026rsquo;re in position 1, and you want to go to 5. You have SecondsPerItem set to 1; so it would take a second to go through each item, totalling 5 seconds.\nWith SetFastCatchup, it will speed up based on how many items it needs to jump through to scroll roughly the same amount of time it takes to scroll to one.\nSetLoop (bool state) Toggles looping.\nSetWrap (bool state)\nToggles wrapping.\nSetMask (bool state)\nToggles the Mask.\nSetNumItemsToDraw (number numItems)\nChanges the value of items to draw at once.\nGetFullScrollLengthSeconds Returns the total amount of time it would take to do a full rotation of the entire scroller. This is counting all of the items and subdivisions with the amount of time set in per item (SecondsPerItem).\nGetCurrentItem Returns the currently selected item.\nGetDestinationItem Gets the item that the scroller is currently traveling to.\nGetNumItems Returns the number of items available on the ActorScroller.\n","description":"The Actorscroller is an ActorFrame that acts as a scroller, allowing for a selection-styled menu with choices and animations.\nDef.ActorScroller{ NumItemsToDraw = 3, SecondsPerItem = 3, TransformFunction = function(self, offset, itemIndex, numItems) end, Subdivisions = 4, UseMask = false, MaskWidth = 30, MaskHeight = 50, LoopScroller = false, WrapScroller = false, } Attributes Adding actors The direct method.

While holding left shift, it creates a roll note depending on how long you hold the column specific key. Holding the column key alone creates a long note, otherwise known as a Hold, which requires players to hold the button until the entire hold has transpired.\nMine This note should be avoided by the player, as they lose life if they hit it. Holding Left Shift will create a roll-based MineField, which is a hold note that should be avoided, as any press can cause the player to lose life. Holding the column key alone will create a hold-based Minefield, which behaves the same way as the roll version.\nLift These notes require the player to release the column when the note arrives to its corresponding receptor. Creating holds or rolls (Left Shift) in this mode creates a Lift-Hold/Roll, which behaves like a regular hold or roll, but contains a lift at the end, which requires the player to perform the same action as a lift, releasing at the right time at the end of the hold/roll.\nFake These notes are purely visual, and do not affect score. They can be used to confuse the player or to construct visual gimmicks. Currently holds/rolls created in this mode will be transformed to regular holds/rolls from the Tap type.\nThe Alter Menu Beat This option allows you to either compress or expand a selected area in both notes and timing, which can be useful if you want to create areas that have a faster or slower feeling.\nStutter segment Introduced in OutFox Alpha ??, this option generates a \u0026ldquo;stutter\u0026rdquo; segment, which comprises of each note including a stop that retains the original timing of the song, giving the illusion of multiple stops in quick succession. An option is included to toggle the inclusion of mines in the calculation, if they\u0026rsquo;re off, mines are skipped in the calculation and are not stopped in playback.\nPlay Selection Plays the currently selected section. Once the cursor has passed the section, it will be looped.\nRecord Selection Allows you to record the currently selected section. This mode enters Record Mode, where you can use the regular keys to place notes in real time with the music.\nAssign as Preview Makes the current selection become the music preview that is played while selecting the song. Note that most themes have a potential fade out of about 3 seconds.\nConvert selection to stop Converts the selected area into a stop, by compressing the area and placing a stop with the duration of the selection. Keep in mind however that any notes that are included inside the area will be deleted.\nConvert selection to delay Converts the selected area into a delay, by compressing the area and placing a delay with the duration of the selection.

Here we will list the items used in the engine, and talk about custom sounds.\nEach item folder on the following list can contain any amount of sounds inside it. The game will pick randomly which one to play.\nEngine-defined sounds The engine can play certain sounds from the announcer, as long as the name is named correctly based on the following list:\nFor ScreenTitleMenu title menu game name Plays when entering the title menu. Usually recites the name of the game.\nFor ScreenWithMenuElements As noted on the Introduction to Theming\u0026rsquo;s guide to creating a custom screen, almost every screen is inherited on ScreenWithMenuElements, meaning that all screens that use this class as a base will play announcers like this, where \u0026lt;Screen Name\u0026gt; applies.\n\u0026lt;Screen Name\u0026gt; intro A message played when the player enters this screen.\nhurry up Plays when the timer is running low on time.\nFor ScreenSelect Same rules apply from ScreenWithMenuElements, meaning that the intro message can also be used here.\n\u0026lt;Screen Name\u0026gt; IdleComment Plays after every specified amount of seconds have passed. This if often used to remind the player to do something in the game.\nThe amount of time can be changed on the screen\u0026rsquo;s IdleCommentSeconds metric.\nFor ScreenSelectMaster ScreenSelectMaster is the name of the class type of several different screens, so these will actually occur on any of the following: ScreenTitleMenu, ScreenSelectLanguage, ScreenUnlockBrowse, ScreenSelectStyle, ScreenSelectPlayMode, ScreenGameInformation, or any other screen that has ScreenSelectMaster as its Class metric.\nselect difficulty challenge Plays when the player enters the second page.\nChoices on ScreenSelectMaster are split into two pages, all choices after the amount set by the NumChoicesOnPage1 metric are on the second page. The default is 1024, so this will never play unless the theme sets the metric lower to have a second page. \u0026lt;Screen Name\u0026gt; comment \u0026lt;Choice Name\u0026gt; Players when the player has picked their Choice.\nFor example: In ScreenSelectStyle2, a screen that could select the kind of style to play; you are presented with 3 choices: single, versus or double, and the player chooses double. Then the end result would end up looking like this:\nScreen Name: ScreenSelectStyle2 Choice Name: double Thus:\nScreenSelectStyle2 comment double \u0026lt;Choice Name\u0026gt; will be the name field of the gamecommand that defines the choice, so this could be literally anything the themer feels like.\nFor this example, it ended up being double, which would look something like this:\n# Note here that the 3 can also change, but DOES NOT apply to the scope of announcers, only the name field.

This is because themes can play their any sound from the announcers, without a name limit.\nBecause of this however, you need to be wary about compatibility with said announcers on other themes, as there can be situations where the announcer pack is compatible with the theme it was designed for, and other themes won\u0026rsquo;t play all the sounds that come with the announcer.\nAn example of custom playback:\nSOUND:PlayAnnouncer(\u0026#34;My Custom Sound\u0026#34;) If the announcer doesn\u0026rsquo;t contain a folder named My Custom Sound with a sound file inside, it will be ignored.\n","description":"Announcers are a set of folders containing audio data for various kinds of situations.

Additional folders are paths configured in the Preferences.ini file; for instance, you can store your song library on a second hard drive and link to it there, or share content between multiple installations. These content folders comprise the game\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Virtual File System\u0026rdquo; (VFS).

Fonts designed for specific timing modes have a modifier in their file name, such as [Advanced], [FAPlus], etc. A judgement font can also be divided into two columns to display indicators for early or late timing.\nNoteSkins NoteSkins affect the appearance of notes. They could be arrows, bars, circles, pawprints, etc.\nNoteSkins that are compatible with StepMania 5.0.12 and 5.1 are compatible with Project OutFox.\nThe NoteSkins folder is divided into subfolders for specific game types.
