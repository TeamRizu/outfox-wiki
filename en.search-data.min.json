(Incorporates Internal Builds 4.12.0-rc0 to 4.12.0-rc7)    (Incorporates Internal Builds 4.11.1-rc0 to 4.11.1-rc17)    (Incorporates Internal Builds 5.0.0-editor-preview-r0 to 5.0.0-editor-preview-r31)     New Folder Locations and Short News Update.    This release will be moving the base application, folders and it\u0026rsquo;s naming to \u0026lsquo;OutFox\u0026rsquo;. This means it will not be using the \u0026lsquo;stepmania5.3\u0026rsquo; folder anymore, and it will install into an outfox folder. You will need to move your profiles over to this new version. The old version will also need to be uninstalled manually, sorry about all of this, it is just for this update.\nThere is no conspiracy behind the name change, we have to do this for application signing on the Mac and for the \u0026lsquo;MS Smart Screen\u0026rsquo; requirements for the certificates we need on Windows. This allows us to continue to be a free rhythm game that is now signed to ensure your confidence in the project, as well as ensuring the installers and packages are not tampered with. The Windows builds will be signed starting from next year, as it has taken time for the verification to complete. Our MacOS builds have been signed for a few alpha versions now, and with the \u0026lsquo;universal\u0026rsquo; binaries we are making the Mac experience better for our Apple Players.\nWith this release we are announcing that Project OutFox is becoming it\u0026rsquo;s own official fork. This gives an end to the confusion about our direction and this also allows those who wish to keep 5.1 installed having no risk of OutFox over-writing or damaging profiles or stored scores.\nI\u0026rsquo;d like to thank the StepMania community for making this decision a lot easier. The project is not the same as we started out in early 2019, and we are sorry we were unable to have a clearer \u0026lsquo;direction\u0026rsquo; than just \u0026lsquo;modernising the codebase\u0026rsquo; when we started. It is not our place to shoehorn this project into the StepMania repo, and a lot of you were very open about your feelings about that and as a result, Project OutFox will be on it\u0026rsquo;s own moving forward, and we will discuss with the StepMania community about what support we can bring in the future.\nThis month, we start off on our journey as a new standalone project, and thus a very exciting time ahead for our team. We have a new touch based theming system coming, new online, new leader-boards, (more new modes of course!) new platforms and modernisations to come over the next year. With the 2nd anniversary of the Public Alpha Programme, the team thanks you for the support and the good vibes you have brought us as we work on this project, and we hope you\u0026rsquo;ll stay with us for the rest of the journey!\n Signed Mac builds update!    We have continued to work on our Mac builds since the last alpha, and this alpha will be released as a universal binary. This means we do not need to quarantine, nor worry about the systems we needed in the past to get the game to work. OutFox is fully signed and notorised, so this means installation is convenient and easy moving forward; you do not need to worry about which build to grab, as both will function as expected.\n New Unicode/SHIFT-JIS support!    This build also has very long overdue extended character support in the file handlers. BeMusic Script, and DTXMania files use different encodings to .SSC and .SM simfiles, and in the past, they often showed up as garbage characters, or mojibake characters which could not be easily read into the game. A simple fix for this was to convert the simfile into UTF8, but with many hundreds of files, this is not reasonable to ask of players!\n(DTXMania Files natively loading)    This build correctly can detect the encoding with no user interaction, and will load them as expected into the correct game mode.\nThe new supported encoding types are:\n ANSI/Windows Extended (SMA/BMS/DWI/KSF) SHIFT-JIS (BMS/BME/PMS/DTX/GDA/TJA) UTF-8 (DTX/BME/SSC/SM/OTO) UTF-8 BOM (GDA/DTX/TJA) UTF-8 Extended (TJA/BME/DTX) UTF-16 (DTX) UTF-16LE (DTX) UTF-16LE BOM (DTX) UCS-2 (DTX)  This will mean songs using the new code paths for the encoding support will take a little bit longer to parse the first time, but having the support over not having it is worth it.\nThere will be opportunities to optimise the loading path, so it will get faster again!\n(BME files encoded in SHIFT-JIS natively loading)     New and Updated Input Options!    ALL OS: portmidi comes out of beta!    prototype fsr midi controller    This driver was written to accommodate the new DTXMania like mode, as the drum kits a lot of players use are MIDI based. This was the first time that our engine contained a fully functioning cross platform MIDI driver, the previous semi-broken win32-midi being Windows only. This new driver offers a 1ms clock timer and near realtime input on Linux and Mac OSX, but only supports one device connected to the system.\nWe are in the process of designing a MIDI based FSR controller for modes which need it as the MIDI system is currently the lowest latency for Windows based systems, and we hope to open source this in time, when the code is better (and Squirrel has the time!)\nThe reason we kept it in beta for so long was there was an identified need to have a MIDI driver capable of supporting more than one MIDI input device, as had been requested by be-mu and gddm players, like DTXMania has, being able to add a second device to enable menu control, or to enable non-standard setups, for example pedals or ride cymbals from a second kit.\nTo assist with this need, we added another MIDI driver to the game:\nrtmidi\nThis driver allows for more than one device support compared to our portmidi driver, which is limited to a single device, like an e-drum kit, or a DJ controller. rtmidi allows for more than one device to be connected for 2 player use, or for extra control for menu options for example.\nThe new rtmidi or portmidi driver can be added to your preference.ini if you wish to use it:\nPlease Note: You will need to add one of these so your controller will work!\nWindows\n(portmidi - you only have one device): InputDrivers=portmidi,legacy,minisdl (rtmidi - you have more than one device): InputDrivers=rtmidi,legacy,minisdl Mac OS (M1 and Intel)\n(portmidi - you only have one device): InputDrivers=portmidi,SDL (rtmidi - you have more than one device): InputDrivers=rtmidi,SDL Linux (x86_64/ARM/Raspberry Pi)\n(portmidi - you only have one device): InputDrivers=portmidi,SDL (rtmidi - you have more than one device): InputDrivers=rtmidi,SDL  WINDOWS: legacy set to be the default and is out of beta!    If you have been reading the previous changelogs, we have been testing a slightly modified version of the old SM4/5 input driver for those that prefer the \u0026lsquo;feel\u0026rsquo; of that era in input timing, and until the new GA driver is finished, (we are waiting for the Q1 2022 Win10/Win11 update) we will set this driver as default from this alpha.\nIf you are on an established preference.ini, to use it you can follow the style above:\nlegacy (Windows Only)    InputDrivers=legacy,minisdl You can also leave this blank, or add MIDI if you plan to play DTX or use a MIDI based input device in the future. You will need the minisdl input driver for your window and operating system controllers, it allows for a smaller footprint on the game, and for your windows based playback this is important at the moment. It shows up in the \u0026lsquo;test input\u0026rsquo; screen as \u0026lsquo;Window Handler (aux)\u0026rsquo; so you have window controls, and full-screen etc support while keeping the base drivers compact. This driver will be default on all operating systems in due course, when the GA driver is complete.\nif you however need to have an Xinput supported device, or you have an advanced setup, you can reset the driver to how it was before this alpha with a simple change in your preference.ini:\nSDL Driver (Windows Only)    InputDrivers=SDL This will enable the support for the Xinput system, and the legacy system in the default theme experimental options, (the UseOldJoystickMapping one) which will allow you to switch between the options.\n If you use a ParaParaParadise controller you will need to add the Para Driver (windows only right now!) before your options in preferences.\nLegacy Driver (Windows Only)    InputDrivers=Para,legacy,minisdl SDL Driver (Windows Only)    InputDrivers=Para,SDL  If you use a Reflex controller, you have several options, however it is best on Windows if you use the new legacy driver for now. To enable the Reflex controller , you need to add the following to your entry: (please note: You need legacy for keyboard input and to avoid HIDAPI problems!)\n(Only one player is supported at this time, however if there is demand we can add more player support! Bug Squirrel for more information!)\nReflex Driver (Windows Only)    InputDrivers=Reflex,legacy,minisdl  If you have a Python2/3 controller, like the above set up for the Reflex you can simply add your entry here, (remember to set up your COM ports etc as seen in the Windows Device Manager) and remember that this device is not seen in Windows 8 or higher due to the change in the way USB controllers became emulated.\nWindows Only    InputDrivers=Python23IO,legacy,minisdl  If you have a Rtio controller, you need to add this as the other controllers, remember that legacy gives you keyboard and mouse support.\nWindows Only    InputDrivers=Rtio,legacy,minisdl  Announcing smx mode!    This month we are proud to announce initial support for the smx mode. This mode is a simulation of the game StepManiaX (https://stepmaniax.com/) by Step Revolution, and are long time friends of our project. You can join their discord here and give them some support!\nWe respectfully ask you to not try to rip or use official assets or songs as we want to keep the arcade scene alive and support the guys over at SMX! OutFox will not support the arcade timings or the smx sim file format, so please do not ask us for this!    This mode was planned to be an Alpha V release, but with the pandemic, and the fact many of our players with SMX pads requested it. The pads are released when ready but you can Buy the pads here! and see when they are available again.\nThis mode will have some of the first non-arcade charted SMX files coming in the winter update of the OutFox Serenity Pack Volume 1.5 coming soon!\nSerenity smx charts    The game mode is best played with the itg based timing, and the layout is familiar:\nIn game footage    This mode has several cool new features with the beat bars, and with popular request we have added the colour differences to show the BPM/Stop changes on the notefield:\nPlease be aware that autoGen does work with this mode, and that we\u0026rsquo;ve been working on improving the memory use with the autogeneration until we have talented charters creating new content for it. Any other 5K sim-files that OutFox supports will work.\n We say farewell to kb7 mode!    The mode introduced with Team SSC has been retired in this alpha. There were many players who wanted it to be more than it was, and the use of the mode was generally for a small set of players, and the original creators of the mode also wished for it to be retired as well when we got the chance.\nWe salute the mode and what it did for StepMania at the time when it was released, but fear not kb fans and players, we are proud to announce:\nIntroducing kbx Mode!    This is a revamp and rewrite of the KB7 mode, aimed at players that wanted a specific down-scrolling game mode, but with different sets of columns. We of course have varying modes with different sets and styles already, but there was no actual option to have things set in one specific place and one specific mode for it.\nThis mode supports 1 to 15 columns, and is a single player option. It will eventually get it\u0026rsquo;s own theme and other mechanics, but for now, it will fall back to our usual theme, but this does not make it any less playable!\nWe have decided to follow along the play style of ez2, or o2jam style of games, but giving our own little twist on things as is common with OutFox modes. In the future, there will be options to set this mode up to how you prefer, with styles and timing/scoring available to change up and adjust as always.\nThere is one specific thing about this mode however, The mod system is disabled. You may be wondering why we took the time to write a \u0026lsquo;slimmer\u0026rsquo; player options for this mode, well, in honesty there are a lot of things happening in the background we don\u0026rsquo;t use in some modes, and we wanted to try out turning some of these things off to see how it works with the game and performance styles.\nThe default noteskin for this game is based off of a synthwave style from the 80s, and we will continue to create the theme with this aesthetic.\nPLEASE NOTE: You do NOT need to turn on autoGen for this mode! The game will automatically create charts in the format and column size of supported sim files already on your system!    The mode comes with a variety of noteskins and features out of the box, alongside a new interface and feature!\nThis skin reads the input assigned to each column and prints it within the space for you to remember where things are. This is helpful for you to learn the mode, and to discover play methods that you are comfortable with.\nThe default mapping for this mode is as follows: Please bear in mind, the button layout still needs work!\nkb1 = space kb2 = f j kb3 = f space j kb4 = d f j k kb5 = d f space j k kb6 = s d f j k l kb7 = s d f space j k l kb8 = a s d f j k l ; kb9 = a s d space f j k l ; kb10 = a w s d f j k l p ; kb11 = a w s d f space j k l p ; kb12 = a w s d r f j i k l p ; kb13 = a w s d r f space j i k l p ; kb14 = a w s e d r f j i k o l p ; kb15 = a w s e d r f space j i k o l p ; This set is just the auto-mapping, and as is always with OutFox everything is completely remappable, you can also assign controllers, MIDI input, drums, DJ controllers, pads etc to this and play in any way you like!\nThis is the o2jous noteskin which has the same feature that shows the keyboard mapping, but is less vibrant on the eyes.\nThe other news about this mode, is we have begun work on the OTO parser to enable osu \u0026amp; osz file support. We support the mania mode (3) at this time - (we were unable to finish the taitai (1) support in time, it will come soon!) The game reads them and can play them with synched video and bg changes, but we do not support osr or osb at this time.\nYou must place the files in the group folder as you would as normal with sim files from other modes. They will be created as a kbx chart type, they will NOT change over to dance or any other mode at this time! (unless you autoGen for them)\nThis mode supports multiple difficulty per folder, and will not make some versions \u0026lsquo;disappear\u0026rsquo; as the old versions did, and if there are multiple different songs in the same folder, the OTO parser can read and differentiate between the chart and it\u0026rsquo;s song/background, meaning you do not need to swap out anything or move stuff to individual folders. We will look into making this option available to other modes in the future. This new parser is based off of the .chart parser using line by line, splitting up each section into it\u0026rsquo;s own loading function.\nAs we were testing this mode, many of our awesome testing players suggested that we should have a \u0026lsquo;Lift-Hold\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;Normal Hold\u0026rsquo; modifier, to make the game more accessible and fun as sometimes the lift-hold requirement raised the difficulty of the chart too much, or players felt overly punished by the placement of the lift holds.\nThis alpha has a new modifier for this, it is available on the song options -\u0026gt; modifiers as seen in the screenshot below. Remember to access this you need to double tap when you have selected a song on the music wheel!\nThese options give a different play style to the pink game, and makes it a lot more accessible to folks playing.\nWe hope you have fun with it, and do let us know what you think!\n KNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.12.0     ❕❌ ISSUE Playing be-mu/po-mu songs on Endless Mode may have a crash on song loading.

We have continued to worked on our Mac builds since the last alpha, and this alpha will be released as a universal binary. This means we do not need to quarantine, nor worry about the systems we needed in the past to get the game to work. OutFox is fully signed and notorised, so this means installation is convenient and easy moving forward; you do not need to worry about which build to grab, as both will function as expected.\n BMS updates!    Difficulty Changes:\nWe have adjusted the way the game reads these files, and as a lot of the charts are seen as the same difficulty we would end up losing a lot of the information in them, and half of the charts would be missing and unplayable. We are in the process of improving this further for the new theming, so it will be better in time.\nThis month continues our work on BMS support, and we can happily announce we have proper Land Mine channel support in the game for the first time! In previous versions there was a blanket math overflow which meant that a lot of the channels were not being identified correctly, and thus flagging for extended channels were not being used.\nThis month also sees some fixes with the Long Note support offered by the game, we did not seem to parse these correctly due to the flag sometimes being applied in the wrong manner, which meant some of the holds were not being applied in charts.\nWe have also restored #RANDOM support again this alpha, as it was still using a legacy codepath we did not clear up in 4.9.10, apologies for that! This alpha allows for the #RANDOM n where n is 1 onwards.\nThis alpha also included several behavioural changes in the way the files are parsed, allowing for the correct Base to be used in reading channels and allowing us to enable the missing hidden sounds as well as the missing channels that were inaccessible before.\nLand Mine damage based on the channel value will be added next alpha, so we can add this final part to the game.\n po-mu updates!    Like with BMS, the fixes with the difficulty are passed along to all of the BMS-like parsers, so we are now able to view all of the difficulties a file may contain.\nWe have been able to adjust the channels used for po-mu to support Land Mines for the first time as well, and this also includes BME based po-mu files are properly supported as well in this alpha, though without locale emulation, they will not load in native Windows 10 at this time. A fix for this is coming soon.\n gddm updates!    This mode has had some internal reworking due to recommendations from some of the DTXMania community (thanks APPROVED!) to ensure that we do a few things a little bit more to how players expect. One of the important features was the ability to change the lane setting from 10 to 9 lane, or 9 to 10 lane, depending on the e-drum kit you have.\nWe were already able to read and support multiple lanes in older alpha builds depending on the \u0026lsquo;dominant\u0026rsquo; right hand lane, but now if the game does not spot it as the style you wish you can change this in the options menu.\nReal mode is 10 lane, and New mode is 9 lane. This gives you the flexibility to play the game how you wish moving forwards with the new theme and makes things less awkward if you do not have a 10 piece e-drum kit.\nThis alpha has also worked a bit more on the latency issues plaguing some users, we have tweaked the keysound flow a lot this build, so please give it a try and let us know if this has improved gameplay for this mode.\nThis build also has had work on the \u0026lsquo;Channel 02/BL\u0026rsquo; support to remove the old BMS era restriction. This means any measure change/time signature change is now respected, and thanks to APPROVED to making this chart which was a literal BPM Change / Time Signature Change Spam Chart we were able to effectively fix this for good. This change is also reflected in the gdgf mode as well as the GDA parser.\n gdgf updates!    Before this alpha, all the game was able to use on this mode was Autogen based charts. Thanks to Squirrel and Jousway, the parser has been finally fixed and implemented to allow 3 fret and 5 fret guitar and bass charts to finally load natively in engine.\nThank you all for your patience while we worked on this, it was a slog to try to transpose the system to something our game recognises!\nGDGF is based on a row system, and our internal mechanism is column based, and has been for some time, so ensuring this methodology is carried over was important. We still have a lot to do before simulation is better here, so please bear with us. We do NOT support the holds yet that were introduced in DTXMania AL, these will be done at a later date.\nThis mode also has had the 6 fret custom mode that we promised back in the spring, as we know a lot of folks wanted 6 fret availability in OutFox. We have chosen cyan as the sixth fret to follow the colour scheme of Yellow Pink Cyan from the original.\nThis mode also supports full up, down, and forward WAIL controls, as requested by members of the community. To map this you will need to ensure your controller has the options to allow for wailing, as many newer guitar controllers have special \u0026lsquo;button\u0026rsquo; modes for wailing. We will add new controller pages to the wiki to help players set up their games in due course.\nWe have also begun a project to release a new proposal for a BMS-like BGF based parser for this mode which will include all 6 frets. Squirrel will be adding the information for this on the wiki for discussion and feedback is more than welcome!    Remember! The game styles have changed for GDGF in this alpha. We will update the OutFox Serenity pack to reflect this during October\n gh updates!    We have continued to work on the internal mechanics on this mode, so do forgive us while we fix things! This alpha sees new backplate (highway) support, (thanks Jous!) and new noteskin support within the engine. the measure lines and textures now behave as expected and thanks to those of you that requested these features.\nThe internal notefield and scrolling system has seen some updates as well as we move towards Alpha V.\n dance updates!    This mode also saw some updates this month; the RNG system was given a revamp, the stageseed generation was also fixed, as well as better audio parsing. Thanks for all the reports of the odd edge cases with some of the odd \u0026lsquo;stuttering\u0026rsquo; bits and pieces you sent in! this was due to an undesirable response in the sampler expecting a calculation from the \u0026lsquo;old\u0026rsquo; resampler path that didn\u0026rsquo;t exist on the new resampler so we tweaked it to stop this.\nThere has been other engine adjustments, we discovered a few other weird bugs in how the buffer works due to the new Keysound code for BMS and po-mu and this has resolved a bug for dance modes.\n techno updates!    We fixed the methodology of the lifebars and the odd crashes with the styles and different play styles available to this mode. There were a lot of edge case crashes which we have fixed for now. In regards to styles, we WILL be fixing the ability to play different styles per player. It\u0026rsquo;s disabled for now to just prevent arcade cab crashes.\n KNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.10.0     ❕❌ ISSUE Playing beat/popnsongs on Endless Mode may have a crash on song loading.

I\u0026rsquo;m giving you a little update from OutFox HQ as I am sure you are curious on what went on with the 4.9.9 release and its many tweaks and Hotfix builds.\nSo let me describe what happened and why we did what we did.\nTo prepare for the new parsing and profile system that is upcoming for Alpha V, it is time that the engine is modernised to support more than just \u0026ldquo;American English\u0026rdquo; and the ANSI/ASCII standard. For those who don\u0026rsquo;t like the abbreviations, it means text in English. OutFox, and historically StepMania was never really written with foreign language support or any type of loading or conversion support for files or text in different languages other than American English.\nAs you know we are expanding the game modes the engine supports and as a result of this, it adds new improvements to the \u0026ldquo;bread and butter modes\u0026rdquo; (dance, pump) so it benefits everyone in the long run. Last month we upgraded the internal parsing system to proper understand Japanese and Korean loading as well as SHIFT-JIS internal text for our pop\u0026rsquo;n/po-mu, BMS, DTX and the DDR charts which used them. This was a really successful update, and fixed around 18 bugs in SM5, and allowed a lot more charts to be successfully loaded into the game.\nBuilding on this success, we then decided to fix the long standing issue of \u0026ldquo;one simfile to rule them all\u0026rdquo; which was: if there were more than one simfile, it only loaded one of those simfiles, usually spotting the SSC then forgetting everything else. As we will be supporting a wide range of new notes loaders in the future, we wanted to remove this bug to expand on specifically BMS/PMS and the Dance charts. This worked once again with great success.\nHowever, it was all about to come undone as our players with cabinets found out.\nFixing these bugs to our horror we were hit with a lot of reports of missing scores, no history found, groovestats and the SRPG groups, as well as everybody.dance and other things built on SM5 literally crashed and burned, due to the reliance on those bugs being included in the code.\nWe rushed to adjust how we did the loading, and we had to for the moment readd the bugs back for groovestats as this was completely broken for folks who wished to share their scores.\nIt also broke saved scores, and hashed lists because we fixed the loading paths, but folks had years of scores on a bugged loader. To top it off, we allowed the evil that was DWI to load, so folks ended up with duplicate listings and all sorts of craziness we did not expect. My own cabinet fell foul of the DWI problem: I had converted them years ago, but never deleted the files. So now we loaded more than one loader, this was a problem!\nI will say thanks to Dominic and Zankoku from the stamina community for taking the time to work through fixing these bugs as we were lost a bit on how the hashing and loading system affected groovestats and the other score sharing systems.\nThe reason we had such a flurry of hotfixes is due to we would solve one bug to have another reported almost an hour or two after we released, so it was a cat and mouse chase to get them fixed as they were affecting cabinets and folks' scores. These bugs only affected dance and ITG due to the fact all of these APIs had been built on them. I am not making excuses here, we should have been more thorough.\nWe had discovered that 21 issues arise within the folder/file parsing system, and that most things depend on this being the way it has been for around 15 years. We have enabled multi loading for other modes and file types, but have returned the SSC -\u0026gt; SM -\u0026gt; DWI rule that was common to the bugs in 5.1.\nWe humbly apologise for this, as we were not expecting that level of damage to established systems in the community. We had to re-enable the bugged code for now until we can look at a new way to fix scores and hashes so that the score shares and players histories are not affected by the new loading system.\nFor the tl;dr - we updated something in our parsers and file loaders, that broke all the scores and share systems due to them being built on bugged code. We had to release loads of fixes as folks reported the bugs.\nI hope that clears things up a bit, and that you don\u0026rsquo;t hate us too much for the errors, we did revert the code to ensure backwards compatibility was maintained. It sometimes happens in alpha development, we do sometimes update things with the best intentions, which breaks a \u0026ldquo;StepMania thing\u0026rdquo; horribly. The codebase is still a massive adventure for us too.\nThis update brings together all the hotfixes and finally puts a lot of the little niggles to rest.\n ALL:     ❕✅ Fixed Pitch being offsync a bit ❕✅ Fixed crash with missing GDDM Strings ❕✅ Fixed hang crash with leaving screens ❕✅ Fixed resampler ❕✅ NEW Column Judgements for modes that need it: gddm/popn ❕✅ NEW PomuPlus judgements ❕✅ Fixed crash in DTX with some files not using the full 9 lane width ❕✅ NEW Add KeySound loading Screen ❕✅ Fixed Crash with SM/SSC loaders ❕✅ Fixed Crash with OpenGL \u0026lt; 2.1 initialisation ❕✅ Added new loading screen animation for BMS/PMS etc ❕✅ Fixed resampling of \u0026lt; 32kHz sound files ❕✅ Fixed downsampling of 48kHz sound files ❕✅ Fixed block on ragesound causing edge case crash ❕✅ Allowed loading window to be software if system has no DRI on linux ❕✅ Fixed AFT overflow in texture generation, caused issues on Mac M1/RPi ❕✅ Fixed attacks disappearing on Linux and MacOS ❕✅ Fixed orient math ❕✅ Fixed non column judgement modes having lua errors on mods/autogen ports ❕✅ Fixed visibility with PIU noteskins ❕✅ Removed SM4 era remaining sprites. ❕✅ Optimised BMS and PMS parsing ❕✅ Added #SUBARTIST and #CREDIT support to BMS/PMS ❕✅ Fixed time-spacing calculation of graphs in gameplay ❕✅ Added new drumDTX noteskin ❕✅ Changed sound on taiko keysound ❕✅ Fixed holds on paw noteskin pixel offset ❕✅ NEW GDA parser for BandJAM/GDAMania era 6 lane drum charts ❕✅ Fixed bug in RTIO not noticing player 2 ❕✅ Fixed quirky edge case bugs in DTX and PMS ❕✅ Fixed AV crash in course loader on windows 7-\u0026gt; and MacOS 10.12/10.13 ❕✅ Fixed timing data in BMS derived parsers ❕✅ NEW Keysound notedata layer, reduces lag ❕✅ Fixed measure count update ❕✅ Fixed XInput crash on windows 8/8.1 ❕✅ Fixed keysound calling ❕✅ Fixed crash on syncmachine ❕✅ Fixed crash on autogen when using 32 bit windows 8.x ❕✅ Fixed autokeysounds quirk ❕✅ Fixed error checking in loading window ❕✅ Fixed elements not resetting in SelectMusic Panels ❕✅ Removed all cmd() references from BGAnimations and Background Effects ❕✅ Restored old .SM 3.x/4.x named styles (bm-* / iidx-* /etc) so they use the modern equivalent (ask if any show up with the \u0026lsquo;unknown style/stepstype\u0026rsquo; in the log) ❕✅ Fix Unjoin player being in the wrong place ❕✅ Add maniax default notes ❕✅ CloseFolder message added to CodeDetector ❕✅ Fix Entries for Techno Mode ❕✅ Fix pump noteskin aesthetics ❕✅ Fix steps played in graph display / combo display ❕✅ Add pump luatimings ❕✅ Fix glider note down ❕✅ Add pump judgements ❕✅ Fixed overflow in BM98 channel calls  Hotfix tweak updates     ❕ Fixed missing score issue by restoring bugged SM5.1 code ❕✅ Fixed stats.xml glitch due to bad parse - Thanks Zankoku for the assistance on this! ❕✅ Fixed ScreenMessage Overflow on some systems ❕✅ New libsamplerate resampler - faster pipeline ❕✅ Fixed pointless crash on ScreenMessage ❕✅ Fixed crash/hang when using GrooveStats ❕✅ Fixed hang on Simply Love when using Solo ❕✅ Increased RageLog buffering to prevent overflow crashes with lots of files/Key Sounds ❕✅ Reduced Log output on DTX ❕✅ Fixed visual request on GLX/X11 ❕✅ Removed Windows 98 calls ❕✅ Fixed some obscure 2001 DWI files crash ❕✅ Fixed DWI title destroying hash keys ❕✅ Fixed DWI loading\u0026hellip; nothing at all\u0026hellip; ❕✅ Fixed PMS table corruption ❕✅ Fixed BMS hash table creation ❕✅ Fixed SSC/SM hash generation ❕✅ Fixed Sound buffer width sometimes getting to the max ❕✅ Fixed freeze on Jukebox with some non-dance modes ❕✅ Fixed sound scheduler on Windows/Linux ❕✅ NEW Sound tweaks for haste and rate, based off of new code ❕✅ NEW Sound resample preference, leave it alone for now, as it replicates RageSoundResample fine. ❕✅ Fixed SM hash corruption ❕✅ Fixed DWI being loaded due to lazy people not cleaning their simfile folders ❕✅ The system will not load DWI if an ssc or sm is found ❕✅ Fixed odd SM title bug ❕✅ Fixed Crash with older hardware not supporting what it advertises ❕✅ Fixed Crash with course loading that affected some folks with \u0026gt;640 songs ❕✅ Fixed Notesloader issues with Mac and Linux ❕✅ Fixed GCC / Mac compile ❕✅ Fixed Windows 10/11 affinity issues ❕✅ Fixed Occasional spike on Windows 10/11 when using an XInput controller ❕✅ Taiko adjustments for notefield ❕✅ Fixed SM/SSC loading to be more cabinet friendly.

The big news is we (now finally!) have passed the prerequisites for GateKeeper on Mac, so this hotfix should behave and work fine, without any issues. Do remember to just drag and drop as the dmg lets you know how to do so, and it will run as other applications. Thanks to Jose and Squirrel for their efforts, and Jose for puzzling through, and Jousway for fixing one of the bugs in gh mode which was causing issues as well.\n Notes Loading    There were several issues with the notes loaders and how antivirus/software protection apps were seeing OutFox when we were loading simfiles. This alpha hotfix now has addressed this by allowing you all to add more than one simfile in a song folder, cutting down on the folder rabbit hole. As we move to a more multi-game engine, this will also allow you to keep things tidy on your drive, and ensure it is a seamless experience for you all. Of course, please check the audio files are the same for the chart you are going to add to the folder, as you may find you have a nasty sync issue, but we also now support multidifficulty setups, as this is required for pump and taiko specifically.\n Difficulty System Revamp    This hotfix also sees a tweak to the difficulty system used in OutFox. In the past it was tied to the DDR paradigm and then left to rot as one of those \u0026lsquo;StepMania Things\u0026rsquo;. This however really stifled what we could do within the engine, especially with modes with different names/brackets etc. With the release of gddm and taiko we needed more difficulties than the game offered, so this has now been resolved. Themes which are based off of 5.1/5.0.x will still work due to the numbers being the same as before. If there are any issues with your theme, do let us know, but we have tested several with no issues.\n New #VOLUME and #PAN    These features have been missing from our keysound support since 2002, and we are proud to say that we have them in this hotfix! They are completely supported in gddm from the parser, (do reset your cache of course!) and they also work in beat/popn. taiko will need the support as well, so shout out to Jous for putting up with my waaaahh-luigi on getting it added to the game. This build also supports the hidden chips/keysounds for gddm and we\u0026rsquo;ll work on getting the final compatibility added in due course.\n New gh Modernisation    Due to the need to run with a slightly more secure runtime on Mac OS Catalina/Big Sur/Monterey on the Intel based macs there were some functions in our gh mode which gatekeeper did not approve of. The way the notes were cast have been fixed, fever/star power has been sorted to be more gh3 like, and taps and open strums are also tweaked to be better. Please give them a try and let us know! A theme for this mode is in the works, so apologies for the barebone approach we have at the moment. It\u0026rsquo;s also why we are an alpha after all\u0026hellip;\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/releases/A4.9.9HF3/","title":"OutFox Alpha 4.9.9HF3 Build","parent":"Release History","content":"Release Date: 8th August 2021    \u0026ldquo;How\u0026rsquo;s that new feature coming along?\u0026quot;    (Incorporates Internal Builds 4.9.9HF3a to 4.9.9HF3b)    (Incorporates Internal Builds 4.9.9HF3-rc0 to 4.9.9HF3-rc4)    (Incorporates Internal Builds 4.9.9HF2-rc0 to 4.9.9HF2-rc3)    (Incorporates Internal Builds 4.9.9HF-rc0 to 4.9.9HF-rc4)    Cabinets now have restored scores! We apologise for the issues this update caused. Ensure you have downloaded 4.9.9HF3b    Right, we finally fixed the annoying RageFile glitch that was affecting the hash system to be different to 5.1/5.0.12. Sorry about all this hassle, we fixed a wedge of bugs in the loading system, but did not expect everyone to have built massive amounts of stuff on top of these bugs being there, so we have adjusted the system so backward compatible themes / API / ScoreShare / Groovestats etc once more work again.\nThanks for being so patient while we ironed this out! it has been a pain!\nWhy the hotfix rush?!    For those curious about the flurry of hotfix patches, we fixed the way the game sees a lot of non-ASCII based file names and folder names. This allowed for us to support accented characters as well as glyphs and japanese characters, alongside with what we found before. This allowed for us to finally fix the bug of \u0026lsquo;one file per folder\u0026rsquo; which was done for DWI way back in 2002, so as we move to a more mode agnostic (we support more than one game mode) we can allow users to have simfiles for different modes/games in the same folder. This was perfect on OutFox specific things - but broke most stuff on 5.1/5.0.12 horribly.\nWhat we had not realised was that a lot of things had been built up on this old bugged behaviour over the years, and that for some reason, there was a hash of the path of the simfile which was being picked up by all these systems. This completely changed the reported hash, and thus score reporting things or sharing things suddenly didn\u0026rsquo;t know their hash and it also didn\u0026rsquo;t help with DWI being so jank it broke even how SM saw some of the charts.\nWe have kept the multiloading system in place. We need this for other modes, however we have adjusted carefully the loading system for SM/SSC/DWI so it matches back to how past versions work, so all of these things can remain intact and working.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll need to think hard on how to apply the fixes in the future, as we don\u0026rsquo;t really want all of this all over again!\n ALL:     ❕ Fixed missing score issue by restoring bugged SM5.1 code ❕✅ Fixed stats.xml glitch due to bad parse - Thanks Zankoku for the assistance on this! ❕✅ Fixed ScreenMessage Overflow on some systems ❕✅ New libsamplerate resampler - faster pipeline ❕✅ Fixed pointless crash on ScreenMessage ❕✅ Fixed crash/hang when using GrooveStats ❕✅ Fixed hang on Simply Love when using Solo ❕✅ Increased RageLog buffering to prevent overflow crashes with lots of files/Key Sounds ❕✅ Reduced Log output on DTX ❕✅ Fixed visual request on GLX/X11 ❕✅ Removed Windows 98 calls ❕✅ Fixed some obscure 2001 DWI files crash ❕✅ Fixed DWI title destroying hash keys ❕✅ Fixed DWI loading\u0026hellip; nothing at all\u0026hellip; ❕✅ Fixed PMS table corruption ❕✅ Fixed BMS hash table creation ❕✅ Fixed SSC/SM hash generation ❕✅ Fixed Sound buffer width sometimes getting to the max ❕✅ Fixed freeze on Jukebox with some non-dance modes ❕✅ Fixed sound scheduler on Windows/Linux ❕✅ NEW Sound tweaks for haste and rate, based off of new code ❕✅ NEW Sound resample preference, leave it alone for now, as it replicates RageSoundResample fine.   This mini hotfix (HF2) includes a few things we were going to leave to the next release, but as we had to fix bugs in them anyway, it was easier to apply.\nALL:     ❕✅ Fixed SM hash corruption ❕✅ Fixed DWI being loaded due to lazy people not cleaning their simfile folders ❕✅ The system will not load DWI if an ssc or sm is found ❕✅ Fixed odd SM title bug ❕✅ Fixed Crash with older hardware not supporting what it advertises ❕✅ Fixed Crash with course loading that affected some folks with \u0026gt;640 songs ❕✅ Fixed Notesloader issues with Mac and Linux ❕✅ Fixed GCC / Mac compile ❕✅ Fixed Windows 10/11 affinity issues ❕✅ Fixed Occasional spike on Windows 10/11 when using an XInput controller ❕✅ Taiko adjustments for notefield ❕✅ Fixed SM/SSC loading to be more cabinet friendly.

Please find your save folder and delete the contents of /cache. This will make your first time run of 4.9.9 slightly longer as it has to rebuild the index, but it is to accommodate the new modes/setup etc. Please remember to restart the game after doing a cache build, so you do not have as many issues with memory management.  New (and some Old!) Modes Update Version 2    Following on from the last release, we have continued to improve and revamp the note system for the new modes, with Jousway taking the time to make available new types and styles available that were never before. This month fixes some omissions we made from the last release, which slipped through the testing teams.\n pump    We have fixed the scoring bug that was in the previous build, and thank you for those who took the time to report the issues. Keep in mind that Soundwaves still uses \u0026lsquo;dance\u0026rsquo; paradigms for scoring, but other themes that use different scoring systems based on \u0026lsquo;pump/piu\u0026rsquo; should work correctly now.\nThe tick-count has been tweaked to work correctly as there was a miscalculation in the offset math inherited from upstream. This now behaves as expected.\nGetting random misses on hold heads has been resolved as well as the holds with small tails (mini/micro holds).\nSupport for co-op charts has been added. 5 player is introduced with up to 10 players support, though the noteskins have not been prepared at this time. The numbers on the noteskins are separately labeled so with a few adjustments and extra assets you will be able to update any noteskin to work with co-op. Co-op charts made on StepF2/StepP1 should work on OutFox, however, better note types are currently being developed by Jousway so that there can be more than 3 real players defined. Stay tuned!\nThose of you who have reported that we still have a \u0026lsquo;superb\u0026rsquo; bug on holds, this will be fixed when we introduce the new piu mode - remember the pump mode is getting Quality of Life updates for now, before we move over to updating things properly in the future.\nMicro/Miniholds also do not trigger misses/cause a weird tick to happen anymore, and there also are no \u0026lsquo;phantom\u0026rsquo; mines in long (5+ measure) holds - this was an oddity which has been fixed now.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re still working on improving SF2/SP1 custom charts parsing. Except for a few charts, you can play the majority of content made for it on OutFox with no problems. As always, if you find any oddities make sure you report them to us!\n popn    There was also a reported issue where some of the channels (lanes) of the PMS 7 button mode were not parsing correctly, or were actually being missed completely, resulting in a chart \u0026lsquo;misplacing\u0026rsquo; green and blue lanes. This was due to Squirrel misreading the spec on how BMS98/PMS was transcribed and set up the function wrong. It is fixed in this release.\nWe also have added 18 lane mode (No PMS/(BME) File support yet though!)\nThank you to all of those that took the time to report this and to kick us into getting outfox into a proper BMS/PMS parser. There are still a few features missing from po-mu mode, but these will be added to the game as per the spec (see the table below for more information.)\npopn mode also had a few tweaks and adjustments this alpha mainly in how keysounds are loaded within the game. This should now mean the mode should be smoother overall.\nThanks to the channels being set right, we also are happy to announce another feature to \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; mode: 2 player! This was not available on the original client, but it did always irk us how there was never 2 player options other than 3 button battle. In a future update, there will be a battle mode for \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; but for now, enjoy the 2 player fun. We will finally be having a theme for \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; in OutFox really soon, so this is finally a move from the \u0026lsquo;dance\u0026rsquo; centric era of the application\u0026rsquo;s past.\nHave some fun with mod files from dance on popn-four\nbeat will be getting some attention this next quarter!     para    We have given this mode a polish (and for those with an arcade cab, with 3 sensors doing nothing!) we added the \u0026lsquo;fabled\u0026rsquo; 360, or 8 sensor mode. This mode was designed for in the arcade for when the player twirls or turns, but was never actioned. The sensors for the back are actually there! This mode adds that, and for those who feel adventurous, we will be publishing some information on how to make your own 360 8 sensor panel controller in due course.\n taitai    Announcing our 15th mode!\nTaiTai is based off of a popular game where you hit a drum in it\u0026rsquo;s face. The game is horizontally based, with the notes travelling from right to left, and you hit the drum when the note gets to the receptor. The orange notes are for the inner part of the drum, and the blue ones are for the outer rim of the drum.\nFor the moment, some of the quirkier parts of this mode are a work in progress, bear with us as we also write new parsers for this mode. We plan to add support for the special note types and other effects in the game, as well as improve timing and other bits and pieces that are still yet to do.\nOnce more, we have no theme for this yet! (We are an alpha after all!) However, we will have a theme available for this soon that will give the mode polish and a playable feel.\nWe still have the scoring and timing system to finish, along with effects on double notes/taps and the \u0026lsquo;roll\u0026rsquo; notes which you hit as much as you can. Feel free to give it a run and let us know what you think!\nThere is a collection of noteskins including Shizuka, Crystal TaiTai and others.\nThe autogen for this mode has been rewritten by Jousway to include a more TaiTai aware selection of notes, so that we do not get odd holds/overlaps in things. Give it a try!\n gddm    This release sees the long awaited updates to our gddm mode!\nThe lane drawing has been fixed, so that notes or \u0026lsquo;chips\u0026rsquo; as they are referred to display correctly, and we have properly sorted out the \u0026lsquo;merged\u0026rsquo; lane support.\nWe have planned to \u0026lsquo;straddle\u0026rsquo; support for the DTXMania NX/Ver. K layouts for the specified channels from the documentation, as these appear to be the most popular branches of this. A detailed channel support list will follow later on.\nAs of this build we have fixed loading .DTX files and these support most of the DRUM based side of the loading, see the table below. This will be improved in time, as we get better knowledge of this system.\nWe also support the \u0026lsquo;combined\u0026rsquo; lane system which adds lane 2 and lane 3\u0026rsquo;s extra notes, and Real mode (again, REAL filenames are yet to be parsed as such, the engine makes a \u0026lsquo;guess\u0026rsquo; on this!)\ngddm still needs a lot of work, and optimisation before we will consider it \u0026lsquo;ready\u0026rsquo;, so do expect the odd quirk or weird behaviour, and let us know what you think/would like to see as we define the mode and it\u0026rsquo;s featureset and support. we will be working on the gdgf parser in the coming months so that the guitar/bass charts will work as well.\nWe do not support XA file decoding at this time, we are looking into options. If you have a dtx file with XA files contained, they will just be played as silence, but won\u0026rsquo;t crash the game.

Makes it easier to find things you need, and please give us feedback if you feel a mode needs more representing/love!\n Mac OS builds are now signed!    We have finally passed all the requirements to be able to sign the binary, so this means no more xattr stuff anymore! we just act like any other application.\n Mode Status:     New Cross Platform MIDI Driver!    Due to the interest we had been getting from the past two alpha releases in the form of gddm and techno, several players that were not on windows did enquire about the possibility of there being a new MIDI driver available for Mac and Linux users to make use of for their midi fighters, e-drums, etc and we decided as a team to move forward and produce one.\nThe midi driver stands alone, there is no need to have any extra applications \u0026lsquo;translating\u0026rsquo; it to keystrokes, (unless you\u0026rsquo;re doing midi via an iphone or something like that of course), but native midi controllers work a treat. If you have a midi device and want to try this out, you will need to load up your preferences.ini in your save folder, locate the inputdrivers= part, and then make sure it looks like this inputdrivers=portmidi,SDL\nThis will allow the midi driver to load, and set up your device. We have currently coded it for a single device at a time, but do let us know if you feel there is a need for multiple device support, or if you find a device that doesn\u0026rsquo;t behave!\nI also was able to make a prototype mini FSR pad for midi using a teensy LC and some tiny FSR sensors:\nThis worked a treat, so you can definitely get on to some tinkering if you want to make your own devices to play the game!\nThis driver works on Windows, Linux, RPi, Mac OS (intel) / Mac OS (M1) and Rockchip aarch64 SoCs    We are still working on latency and control, so let us know if you find anything quirky!\n Windows legacy input driver    There has also been work done on a small side part of the game, while we have been waiting for a fix from upstream in regards to the \u0026lsquo;polling/framerate\u0026rsquo; issue that a lot of folks have helping us diagnose for some time. The long and the short of the issue, it meant on some songs, the input would skew towards the update loop rather than honouring it\u0026rsquo;s timestamp, thus producing \u0026lsquo;spikes\u0026rsquo; on the scoring graph at the end of the song, and make a odd looking \u0026lsquo;stair\u0026rsquo; display on the scatter plot of the steps and judgements taken.\nTo resolve this while we\u0026rsquo;re waiting a fix, we have reimplemented the old legacy driver that was on 5.2/5.1 and adapted it for OutFox. This driver can be tempremental, but it seemed to behave with the devices we tested it with. If you tend to find that your input is affected with the message loop issue, you can set up the driver with the following instructions.\nYou will need to load up your preferences.ini in your save folder, locate the inputdrivers= part, and then make sure it looks like this inputdrivers=legacy,minisdl\n(if you wish to use the new portmidi driver as well you can use InputDrivers=legacy,minisdl,portmidi)\nThis will allow you to run the game with minimal resources, keeping vsync on, and should remove any previous issues of fps/rate/polling problems. When we have the fix from upstream, we\u0026rsquo;ll revisit and modernise this with the newer drivers and processes.\nOn the \u0026lsquo;test input\u0026rsquo; screen, you will see a new Window Handler \u0026lsquo;Aux\u0026rsquo; driver. This is just the driver that manages the window controls, maximises, fullscreens, etc, so no need to worry about it. This will also show you, that you have the correct drivers selected in the inputdrivers setting.\n Rate and Pitch Changes:    Due to an overwhelming set of requests, we have taken time to fix and modernise the rate/haste system which had been broken for a bit since this project began.\nPitch seemed to be a lottery (though we had not seen it work) and all the rate mod used to do was seemingly speed up the song with no other effect or option being honoured.\nSimilarly, we have moved the ratemod to the first screen of the song options - thanks to the stamina players that popped in to request this, and to mattm for saying that most wanted a speed AND pitch option, which we have called \u0026lsquo;both\u0026rsquo; internally to signify this change.\nThe new layout looks like so:\nWe have fixed the way the off/speed/pitch/speed and pitch options work, so they actually work. This took quite a bit of time to fix the internal pipelines for these, but the end effect is definitely fun. Thanks to Squirrel, Jousway and Jose for bringing this one up the pipeline to get it done for this release!\nTo ensure compatibility with legacy themes, the system \u0026lsquo;defaults\u0026rsquo; to how it was in 5.0.12, with a 0.01x increase, and being on the main menu as folks requested. This is a long overdue Quality of Life update for this, so we\u0026rsquo;re really pleased it\u0026rsquo;s done.\n KNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.9.9     ❕❌ ISSUE gh mode: Some charts have no real \u0026lsquo;standard\u0026rsquo; and will cause a crash when loaded into the game ❕❌ ISSUE techno/popn/gdgf/gddm/gh/para mode: Trying to use the sync audio screen will crash the game - Use dance to sync your game for now ❕❌ ISSUE gddm mode: We do not support the XA codec at this time, it\u0026rsquo;ll play silent. ❕❌ ISSUE beat/popn/gddm some early (pre2013) songs may play some sound samples / keysounds at the wrong speed   Full Changelog Follows:    ALL:    Mode Specific\n ❕✅ Fixed DTX Detection of track/lane sizes overflowing the notefield ❕✅ Fixed BMS/DTX/PMS Keysound iterator edge crash ❕✅ New!

Sometimes having a monthly release schedule is awesome, but it does tire us out!\nAnyways\u0026hellip; Lets get back to the update.\nThis mini hotfix (v2) includes a few things we were going to leave to the next release, but as we had to fix bugs in them anyway, it was easier to apply.\nALL:     ❕✅ Fixed SM hash corruption ❕✅ Fixed DWI being loaded due to lazy people not cleaning their simfile folders ❕✅ The system will not load DWI if an ssc or sm is found ❕✅ Fixed odd SM title bug ❕✅ Fixed Crash with older hardware not supporting what it advertises ❕✅ Fixed Crash with course loading that affected some folks with \u0026gt;640 songs ❕✅ Fixed Notesloader issues with Mac and Linux ❕✅ Fixed GCC / Mac compile ❕✅ Fixed Windows 10/11 affinity issues ❕✅ Fixed Occasional spike on Windows 10/11 when using an XInput controller ❕✅ Taiko adjustments for notefield ❕✅ Fixed SM/SSC loading to be more cabinet friendly.   Signed Mac builds update!    The big news is we (now finally!) have passed the prerequisites for GateKeeper on Mac, so this hotfix should behave and work fine, without any issues. Do remember to just drag and drop as the dmg lets you know how to do so, and it will run as other applications. Thanks to Jose and Squirrel for their efforts, and Jose for puzzling through, and Jousway for fixing one of the bugs in gh mode which was causing issuess as well.\n Notes Loading    There were several issues with the notes loaders and how antivirus/software protection apps were seeing OutFox when we were loading simfiles. This alpha hotfix now has addressed this by allowing you all to add more than one simfile in a song folder, cutting down on the folder rabbit hole. As we move to a more multi-game engine, this will also allow you to keep things tidy on your drive, and ensure it is a seamless experience for you all. Of course, please check the audio files are the same for the chart you are going to add to the folder, as you may find you have a nasty sync issue, but we also now support multidifficulty setups, as this is required for pump and taiko specifically.\n Difficulty System Revamp    This hotfix also sees a tweak to the difficulty system used in OutFox. In the past it was tied to the DDR paradigm and then left to rot as one of those \u0026lsquo;StepMania Things\u0026rsquo;. This however really stifled what we could do within the engine, especially with modes with different names/brackets etc. With the release of gddm and taiko we needed more difficulties than the game offered, so this has now been resolved. Themes which are based off of 5.1/5.0.x will still work due to the numbers being the same as before. If there are any issues with your theme, do let us know, but we have tested several with no issues.\n New #VOLUME and #PAN    These features have been missing from our keysound support since 2002, and we are proud to say that we have them in this hotfix! They are completely supported in gddm from the parser, (do reset your cache of course!) and they also work in beat/popn. taiko will need the support as well, so shout out to Jous for putting up with my waaaahh-luigi on getting it added to the game. This build also supports the hidden chips/keysounds for gddm and we\u0026rsquo;ll work on getting the final compatibility added in due course.\n New gh Modernisation    Due to the need to run with a slightly more secure runtime on Mac OS Catalina/Big Sur/Monterey on the Intel based macs there were some functions in our gh mode which gatekeeper did not approve of.

Please find your save folder and delete the contents of /cache. This will make your first time run of 4.9.9 slightly longer as it has to rebuild the index, but it is to accommodate the new modes/setup etc. Please remember to restart the game after doing a cache build, so you do not have as many issues with memory management.  New (and some Old!) Modes Update Version 2    Following on from the last release, we have continued to improve and revamp the note system for the new modes, with Jousway taking the time to make available new types and styles available that were never before. This month fixes some omissions we made from the last release, which slipped through the testing teams.\n pump    We have fixed the scoring bug that was in the previous build, and thank you for those who took the time to report the issues. Keep in mind that Soundwaves still uses \u0026lsquo;dance\u0026rsquo; paradigms for scoring, but other themes that use different scoring systems based on \u0026lsquo;pump/piu\u0026rsquo; should work correctly now.\nThe tick-count has been tweaked to work correctly as there was a miscalculation in the offset math inherited from upstream. This now behaves as expected.\nGetting random misses on hold heads has been resolved as well as the holds with small tails (mini/micro holds).\nSupport for co-op charts has been added. 5 player is introduced with up to 10 players support, though the noteskins have not been prepared at this time. The numbers on the noteskins are separately labeled so with a few adjustments and extra assets you will be able to update any noteskin to work with co-op. Co-op charts made on StepF2/StepP1 should work on OutFox, however, better note types are currently being developed by Jousway so that there can be more than 3 real players defined. Stay tuned!\nThose of you who have reported that we still have a \u0026lsquo;superb\u0026rsquo; bug on holds, this will be fixed when we introduce the new piu mode - remember the pump mode is getting Quality of Life updates for now, before we move over to updating things properly in the future.\nMicro/Miniholds also do not trigger misses/cause a weird tick to happen anymore, and there also are no \u0026lsquo;phantom\u0026rsquo; mines in long (5+ measure) holds - this was an oddity which has been fixed now.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re still working on improving SF2/SP1 custom charts parsing. Except for a few charts, you can play the majority of content made for it on OutFox with no problems. As always, if you find any oddities make sure you report them to us!\n popn    There was also a reported issue where some of the channels (lanes) of the PMS 7 button mode were not parsing correctly, or were actually being missed completely, resulting in a chart \u0026lsquo;misplacing\u0026rsquo; green and blue lanes. This was due to Squirrel misreading the spec on how BMS98/PMS was transcribed and set up the function wrong. It is fixed in this release.\nWe also have added 18 lane mode (No PMS/(BME) File support yet though!)\nThank you to all of those that took the time to report this and to kick us into getting outfox into a proper BMS/PMS parser. There are still a few features missing from po-mu mode, but these will be added to the game as per the spec (see the table below for more information.)\npopn mode also had a few tweaks and adjustments this alpha mainly in how keysounds are loaded within the game. This should now mean the mode should be smoother overall.\nThanks to the channels being set right, we also are happy to announce another feature to \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; mode: 2 player! This was not available on the original client, but it did always irk us how there was never 2 player options other than 3 button battle. In a future update, there will be a battle mode for \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; but for now, enjoy the 2 player fun. We will finally be having a theme for \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; in OutFox really soon, so this is finally a move from the \u0026lsquo;dance\u0026rsquo; centric era of the application\u0026rsquo;s past.\nHave some fun with mod files from dance on popn-four\nbeat will be getting some attention this next quarter!     para    We have given this mode a polish (and for those with an arcade cab, with 3 sensors doing nothing!) we added the \u0026lsquo;fabled\u0026rsquo; 360, or 8 sensor mode. This mode was designed for in the arcade for when the player twirls or turns, but was never actioned. The sensors for the back are actually there! This mode adds that, and for those who feel adventurous, we will be publishing some information on how to make your own 360 8 sensor panel controller in due course.\n taitai    Announcing our 15th mode!\nTaiTai is based off of a popular game where you hit a drum in it\u0026rsquo;s face. The game is horizontally based, with the notes travelling from right to left, and you hit the drum when the note gets to the receptor. The orange notes are for the inner part of the drum, and the blue ones are for the outer rim of the drum.\nFor the moment, some of the quirkier parts of this mode are a work in progress, bear with us as we also write new parsers for this mode. We plan to add support for the special note types and other effects in the game, as well as improve timing and other bits and pieces that are still yet to do.\nOnce more, we have no theme for this yet! (We are an alpha after all!) However, we will have a theme available for this soon that will give the mode polish and a playable feel.\nWe still have the scoring and timing system to finish, along with effects on double notes/taps and the \u0026lsquo;roll\u0026rsquo; notes which you hit as much as you can. Feel free to give it a run and let us know what you think!\nThere is a collection of noteskins including Shizuka, Crystal TaiTai and others.\nThe autogen for this mode has been rewritten by Jousway to include a more TaiTai aware selection of notes, so that we do not get odd holds/overlaps in things. Give it a try!\n gddm    This release sees the long awaited updates to our gddm mode!\nThe lane drawing has been fixed, so that notes or \u0026lsquo;chips\u0026rsquo; as they are referred to display correctly, and we have properly sorted out the \u0026lsquo;merged\u0026rsquo; lane support.\nWe have planned to \u0026lsquo;straddle\u0026rsquo; support for the DTXMania NX/Ver. K layouts for the specified channels from the documentation, as these appear to be the most popular branches of this. A detailed channel support list will follow later on.\nAs of this build we have fixed loading .DTX files and these support most of the DRUM based side of the loading, see the table below. This will be improved in time, as we get better knowledge of this system.\nWe also support the \u0026lsquo;combined\u0026rsquo; lane system which adds lane 2 and lane 3\u0026rsquo;s extra notes, and Real mode (again, REAL filenames are yet to be parsed as such, the engine makes a \u0026lsquo;guess\u0026rsquo; on this!)\ngddm still needs a lot of work, and optimisation before we will consider it \u0026lsquo;ready\u0026rsquo;, so do expect the odd quirk or weird behaviour, and let us know what you think/would like to see as we define the mode and it\u0026rsquo;s featureset and support. we will be working on the gdgf parser in the coming months so that the guitar/bass charts will work as well.\nWe do not support XA file decoding at this time, we are looking into options. If you have a dtx file with XA files contained, they will just be played as silence, but won\u0026rsquo;t crash the game.

Makes it easier to find things you need, and please give us feedback if you feel a mode needs more representing/love!\n Mac OS builds are now signed!    We have finally passed all the requirements to be able to sign the binary, so this means no more xattr stuff anymore! we just act like any other application.\n Mode Status:     New Cross Platform MIDI Driver!    Due to the interest we had been getting from the past two alpha releases in the form of gddm and techno, several players that were not on windows did enquire about the possibility of there being a new MIDI driver available for Mac and Linux users to make use of for their midi fighters, e-drums, etc and we decided as a team to move forward and produce one.\nThe midi driver stands alone, there is no need to have any extra applications \u0026lsquo;translating\u0026rsquo; it to keystrokes, (unless you\u0026rsquo;re doing midi via an iphone or something like that of course), but native midi controllers work a treat. If you have a midi device and want to try this out, you will need to load up your preferences.ini in your save folder, locate the inputdrivers= part, and then make sure it looks like this inputdrivers=portmidi,SDL\nThis will allow the midi driver to load, and set up your device. We have currently coded it for a single device at a time, but do let us know if you feel there is a need for multiple device support, or if you find a device that doesn\u0026rsquo;t behave!\nI also was able to make a prototype mini FSR pad for midi using a teensy LC and some tiny FSR sensors:\nThis worked a treat, so you can definitely get on to some tinkering if you want to make your own devices to play the game!\nThis driver works on Windows, Linux, RPi, Mac OS (intel) / Mac OS (M1) and Rockchip aarch64 SoCs    We are still working on latency and control, so let us know if you find anything quirky!\n Windows legacy input driver    There has also been work done on a small side part of the game, while we have been waiting for a fix from upstream in regards to the \u0026lsquo;polling/framerate\u0026rsquo; issue that a lot of folks have helping us diagnose for some time. The long and the short of the issue, it meant on some songs, the input would skew towards the update loop rather than honouring it\u0026rsquo;s timestamp, thus producing \u0026lsquo;spikes\u0026rsquo; on the scoring graph at the end of the song, and make a odd looking \u0026lsquo;stair\u0026rsquo; display on the scatter plot of the steps and judgements taken.\nTo resolve this while we\u0026rsquo;re waiting a fix, we have reimplemented the old legacy driver that was on 5.2/5.1 and adapted it for OutFox. This driver can be tempremental, but it seemed to behave with the devices we tested it with. If you tend to find that your input is affected with the message loop issue, you can set up the driver with the following instructions.\nYou will need to load up your preferences.ini in your save folder, locate the inputdrivers= part, and then make sure it looks like this inputdrivers=legacy,minisdl\n(if you wish to use the new portmidi driver as well you can use InputDrivers=legacy,minisdl,portmidi)\nThis will allow you to run the game with minimal resources, keeping vsync on, and should remove any previous issues of fps/rate/polling problems. When we have the fix from upstream, we\u0026rsquo;ll revisit and modernise this with the newer drivers and processes.\nOn the \u0026lsquo;test input\u0026rsquo; screen, you will see a new Window Handler \u0026lsquo;Aux\u0026rsquo; driver. This is just the driver that manages the window controls, maximises, fullscreens, etc, so no need to worry about it. This will also show you, that you have the correct drivers selected in the inputdrivers setting.\n Rate and Pitch Changes:    Due to an overwhelming set of requests, we have taken time to fix and modernise the rate/haste system which had been broken for a bit since this project began.\nPitch seemed to be a lottery (though we had not seen it work) and all the rate mod used to do was seemingly speed up the song with no other effect or option being honoured.\nSimilarly, we have moved the ratemod to the first screen of the song options - thanks to the stamina players that popped in to request this, and to mattm for saying that most wanted a speed AND pitch option, which we have called \u0026lsquo;both\u0026rsquo; internally to signify this change.\nThe new layout looks like so:\nWe have fixed the way the off/speed/pitch/speed and pitch options work, so they actually work. This took quite a bit of time to fix the internal pipelines for these, but the end effect is definitely fun. Thanks to Squirrel, Jousway and Jose for bringing this one up the pipeline to get it done for this release!\nTo ensure compatibility with legacy themes, the system \u0026lsquo;defaults\u0026rsquo; to how it was in 5.0.12, with a 0.01x increase, and being on the main menu as folks requested. This is a long overdue Quality of Life update for this, so we\u0026rsquo;re really pleased it\u0026rsquo;s done.\n KNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.9.9     ❕❌ ISSUE gh mode: Some charts have no real \u0026lsquo;standard\u0026rsquo; and will cause a crash when loaded into the game ❕❌ ISSUE techno/popn/gdgf/gddm/gh/para mode: Trying to use the sync audio screen will crash the game - Use dance to sync your game for now ❕❌ ISSUE gddm mode: We do not support the XA codec at this time, it\u0026rsquo;ll play silent. ❕❌ ISSUE beat/popn/gddm some early (pre2013) songs may play some sound samples / keysounds at the wrong speed   Full Changelog Follows:    ALL:    Mode Specific\n ❕✅ Fixed DTX Detection of track/lane sizes overflowing the notefield ❕✅ Fixed BMS/DTX/PMS Keysound iterator edge crash ❕✅ New!

Sometimes having a monthly release schedule is awesome, but it does tire us out!\nAnyways\u0026hellip; Lets get back to the update.\nThis mini hotfix includes a few things we were going to leave to the next release, but as we had to fix bugs in them anyway, it was easier to apply.\n Signed Mac builds update!    The big news is we (now finally!) have passed the prerequisites for GateKeeper on Mac, so this hotfix should behave and work fine, without any issues. Do remember to just drag and drop as the dmg lets you know how to do so, and it will run as other applications. Thanks to Jose and Squirrel for their efforts, and Jose for puzzling through, and Jousway for fixing one of the bugs in gh mode which was causing issuess as well.\n Notes Loading    There were several issues with the notes loaders and how antivirus/software protection apps were seeing OutFox when we were loading simfiles. This alpha hotfix now has addressed this by allowing you all to add more than one simfile in a song folder, cutting down on the folder rabbit hole. As we move to a more multi-game engine, this will also allow you to keep things tidy on your drive, and ensure it is a seamless experience for you all. Of course, please check the audio files are the same for the chart you are going to add to the folder, as you may find you have a nasty sync issue, but we also now support multidifficulty setups, as this is required for pump and taiko specifically.\n Difficulty System Revamp    This hotfix also sees a tweak to the difficulty system used in OutFox. In the past it was tied to the DDR paradigm and then left to rot as one of those \u0026lsquo;StepMania Things\u0026rsquo;. This however really stifled what we could do within the engine, especially with modes with different names/brackets etc. With the release of gddm and taiko we needed more difficulties than the game offered, so this has now been resolved. Themes which are based off of 5.1/5.0.x will still work due to the numbers being the same as before. If there are any issues with your theme, do let us know, but we have tested several with no issues.\n New #VOLUME and #PAN    These features have been missing from our keysound support since 2002, and we are proud to say that we have them in this hotfix! They are completely supported in gddm from the parser, (do reset your cache of course!) and they also work in beat/popn. taiko will need the support as well, so shout out to Jous for putting up with my waaaahh-luigi on getting it added to the game. This build also supports the hidden chips/keysounds for gddm and we\u0026rsquo;ll work on getting the final compatibility added in due course.\n New gh Modernisation    Due to the need to run with a slightly more secure runtime on Mac OS Catalina/Big Sur/Monterey on the Intel based macs there were some functions in our gh mode which gatekeeper did not approve of. The way the notes were cast have been fixed, fever/star power has been sorted to be more gh3 like, and taps and open strums are also tweaked to be better. Please give them a try and let us know! A theme for this mode is in the works, so apologies for the barebone approach we have at the moment. It\u0026rsquo;s also why we are an alpha after all\u0026hellip;\nALL:    Mode Specific\n ❕✅ Fixed SM/SSC Noteloader corruption with some Japanese and Korean Titles/Artists on dance notesloaders ❕✅ Fixed DTX Noteloader memory leak ❕✅ Fixed DTX Parser missing some drums in gddm mode ❕✅ Fixed BMS Keysounds not seeking/reading correctly ❕✅ Fixed PMS Keysounds not buffering correctly ❕✅ Modernise Keysound system to prevent buffer under-runs ❕✅ Fix BMS/PMS missing channels, Hidden notes will come next Alpha ❕✅ Fix beat crash with charts that had more than 866 keysounds ❕✅ Fix popn crash with charts that had more than 1022 keysounds ❕✅ Fix #VOLUME not being applied correctly to beat and gddm keysounds ❕✅ Fix #PAN not being applied to beat and popn keysounds ❕✅ Fix gh loading crash with some older charts. ❕✅ Fixed RageSound preload causing missing chips in gddm and notes in beat ❕✅ Fixed gh crash due to an overzealous lightsman double update ❕✅ Fixed crash in DTX/BMS/PMS due to strings being over optimised on Mac Intel/Linux ❕✅ Fixed gh note types to please the Mac OS gatekeeper gods ❕✅ Fixed gh open strum notes ❕✅ Fixed gh fever to be closer to gh3 ❕✅ New gh HOPO notes system ❕✅ Fixed gh tap notes not showing up sometimes on older CHART files  Engine\n ❕✅ Fixed Screen msg Bug - Closes 17 year old issue ❕✅ Fixed crash in Jukebox with non-dance modes ❕✅ Fixed overflow in tween awareness - Closes 14 year old issue ❕✅ Fixed Actor overflow on tween actions - Closes 14 year old issue ❕✅ Fixed OptionsPrefs issue - Closes #375 ❕✅ Fixed editor scrolling issue ❕✅ Fixed editor buffer overflow when using \u0026gt;496 keysounds ❕✅ Fixed editor input being sent garbage ❕✅ Fixed editor input parser arrays ❕✅ Fixed crash in practice mode ❕✅ Fixed endless loop with some older BMS/PMS charts in practice mode - Thanks EDMSPack ❕✅ Fixed potential buffer overflow exploit in soundreader ❕✅ Fixed keysounds being stopped when they didn\u0026rsquo;t need to be, forcing a reload of the sound ❕✅ Fixed Keysound index system ❕✅ New Added save on exit theme metrics for option screens ❕✅ Fixed freeze on game select screen due to missing module - Thanks Kaede! ❕✅ Modernised the notesloader system in preparation for more loaders ❕✅ Fixed some types of charts being erroroneously skipped during the parse load ❕✅ NEW Multi Sim File Loading from 1 directory ❕✅ NEW Non DDR difficulty system so we can properly support other modes  Linux\n ❕✅ Fixed crash on linux versions that do not support the new Neutral Vendor libraries ❕✅ Fixed crash on Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora/Arch with inifile due to a race condition ❕✅ Fixed edge case crash on Clear/Fedora preventing the game booting on some 4.x / \u0026lt; 5.1 Kernels  ARM32/ARM64: (Raspberry Pi etc)\n ❕✅ Fixed edge case crash on Twister/Raspbian preventing the game booting on some 4.x Kernels ❕✅ Fixed crash on Raspbian with inifile due to a race condition ❕✅ Fixed crash on RockPi 4B/4C when not using the first HDMI port/Audio  Mac OS\n ❕✅ Fixed input with guitar hero based controllers ❕✅ Rewrote internal gh mode to fix overly harsh input restrictions ❕✅ Fixed internal system to be signed compliant ❕✅ New enhanced build pipeline to ensure signing passes on Mac OS Intel ❕✅ New streamlined and optimised code for Mac M1 now we are properly signed   KNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.9.9HF     ❕❌ ISSUE Song Charts will not pan the player correctly when being played ❕❌ ISSUE Playing beat/popnsongs on Endless Mode may have a crash on song loading.

Please find your save folder and delete the contents of /cache. This will make your first time run of 4.9.9 slightly longer as it has to rebuild the index, but it is to accommodate the new modes/setup etc. Please remember to restart the game after doing a cache build, so you do not have as many issues with memory management.  New (and some Old!) Modes Update Version 2    Following on from the last release, we have continued to improve and revamp the note system for the new modes, with Jousway taking the time to make available new types and styles available that were never before. This month fixes some omissions we made from the last release, which slipped through the testing teams.\n pump    We have fixed the scoring bug that was in the previous build, and thank you for those who took the time to report the issues. Keep in mind that Soundwaves still uses \u0026lsquo;dance\u0026rsquo; paradigms for scoring, but other themes that use different scoring systems based on \u0026lsquo;pump/piu\u0026rsquo; should work correctly now.\nThe tick-count has been tweaked to work correctly as there was a miscalculation in the offset math inherited from upstream. This now behaves as expected.\nGetting random misses on hold heads has been resolved as well as the holds with small tails (mini/micro holds).\nSupport for co-op charts has been added. 5 player is introduced with up to 10 players support, though the noteskins have not been prepared at this time. The numbers on the noteskins are separately labeled so with a few adjustments and extra assets you will be able to update any noteskin to work with co-op. Co-op charts made on StepF2/StepP1 should work on OutFox, however, better note types are currently being developed by Jousway so that there can be more than 3 real players defined. Stay tuned!\nThose of you who have reported that we still have a \u0026lsquo;superb\u0026rsquo; bug on holds, this will be fixed when we introduce the new piu mode - remember the pump mode is getting Quality of Life updates for now, before we move over to updating things properly in the future.\nMicro/Miniholds also do not trigger misses/cause a weird tick to happen anymore, and there also are no \u0026lsquo;phantom\u0026rsquo; mines in long (5+ measure) holds - this was an oddity which has been fixed now.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re still working on improving SF2/SP1 custom charts parsing. Except for a few charts, you can play the majority of content made for it on OutFox with no problems. As always, if you find any oddities make sure you report them to us!\n popn    There was also a reported issue where some of the channels (lanes) of the PMS 7 button mode were not parsing correctly, or were actually being missed completely, resulting in a chart \u0026lsquo;misplacing\u0026rsquo; green and blue lanes. This was due to Squirrel misreading the spec on how BMS98/PMS was transcribed and set up the function wrong. It is fixed in this release.\nWe also have added 18 lane mode (No PMS/(BME) File support yet though!)\nThank you to all of those that took the time to report this and to kick us into getting outfox into a proper BMS/PMS parser. There are still a few features missing from po-mu mode, but these will be added to the game as per the spec (see the table below for more information.)\npopn mode also had a few tweaks and adjustments this alpha mainly in how keysounds are loaded within the game. This should now mean the mode should be smoother overall.\nThanks to the channels being set right, we also are happy to announce another feature to \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; mode: 2 player! This was not available on the original client, but it did always irk us how there was never 2 player options other than 3 button battle. In a future update, there will be a battle mode for \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; but for now, enjoy the 2 player fun. We will finally be having a theme for \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; in OutFox really soon, so this is finally a move from the \u0026lsquo;dance\u0026rsquo; centric era of the application\u0026rsquo;s past.\nHave some fun with mod files from dance on popn-four\nbeat will be getting some attention this next quarter!     para    We have given this mode a polish (and for those with an arcade cab, with 3 sensors doing nothing!) we added the \u0026lsquo;fabled\u0026rsquo; 360, or 8 sensor mode. This mode was designed for in the arcade for when the player twirls or turns, but was never actioned. The sensors for the back are actually there! This mode adds that, and for those who feel adventurous, we will be publishing some information on how to make your own 360 8 sensor panel controller in due course.\n taitai    Announcing our 15th mode!\nTaiTai is based off of a popular game where you hit a drum in it\u0026rsquo;s face. The game is horizontally based, with the notes travelling from right to left, and you hit the drum when the note gets to the receptor. The orange notes are for the inner part of the drum, and the blue ones are for the outer rim of the drum.\nFor the moment, some of the quirkier parts of this mode are a work in progress, bear with us as we also write new parsers for this mode. We plan to add support for the special note types and other effects in the game, as well as improve timing and other bits and pieces that are still yet to do.\nOnce more, we have no theme for this yet! (We are an alpha after all!) However, we will have a theme available for this soon that will give the mode polish and a playable feel.\nWe still have the scoring and timing system to finish, along with effects on double notes/taps and the \u0026lsquo;roll\u0026rsquo; notes which you hit as much as you can. Feel free to give it a run and let us know what you think!\nThere is a collection of noteskins including Shizuka, Crystal TaiTai and others.\nThe autogen for this mode has been rewritten by Jousway to include a more TaiTai aware selection of notes, so that we do not get odd holds/overlaps in things. Give it a try!\n gddm    This release sees the long awaited updates to our gddm mode!\nThe lane drawing has been fixed, so that notes or \u0026lsquo;chips\u0026rsquo; as they are referred to display correctly, and we have properly sorted out the \u0026lsquo;merged\u0026rsquo; lane support.\nWe have planned to \u0026lsquo;straddle\u0026rsquo; support for the DTXMania NX/Ver. K layouts for the specified channels from the documentation, as these appear to be the most popular branches of this. A detailed channel support list will follow later on.\nAs of this build we have fixed loading .DTX files and these support most of the DRUM based side of the loading, see the table below. This will be improved in time, as we get better knowledge of this system.\nWe also support the \u0026lsquo;combined\u0026rsquo; lane system which adds lane 2 and lane 3\u0026rsquo;s extra notes, and Real mode (again, REAL filenames are yet to be parsed as such, the engine makes a \u0026lsquo;guess\u0026rsquo; on this!)\ngddm still needs a lot of work, and optimisation before we will consider it \u0026lsquo;ready\u0026rsquo;, so do expect the odd quirk or weird behaviour, and let us know what you think/would like to see as we define the mode and it\u0026rsquo;s featureset and support. we will be working on the gdgf parser in the coming months so that the guitar/bass charts will work as well.\nWe do not support XA file decoding at this time, we are looking into options. If you have a dtx file with XA files contained, they will just be played as silence, but won\u0026rsquo;t crash the game.

Makes it easier to find things you need, and please give us feedback if you feel a mode needs more representing/love!\n Mac OS builds are now signed!    We have finally passed all the requirements to be able to sign the binary, so this means no more xattr stuff anymore! we just act like any other application.\n Mode Status:     New Cross Platform MIDI Driver!    Due to the interest we had been getting from the past two alpha releases in the form of gddm and techno, several players that were not on windows did enquire about the possibility of there being a new MIDI driver available for Mac and Linux users to make use of for their midi fighters, e-drums, etc and we decided as a team to move forward and produce one.\nThe midi driver stands alone, there is no need to have any extra applications \u0026lsquo;translating\u0026rsquo; it to keystrokes, (unless you\u0026rsquo;re doing midi via an iphone or something like that of course), but native midi controllers work a treat. If you have a midi device and want to try this out, you will need to load up your preferences.ini in your save folder, locate the inputdrivers= part, and then make sure it looks like this inputdrivers=portmidi,SDL\nThis will allow the midi driver to load, and set up your device. We have currently coded it for a single device at a time, but do let us know if you feel there is a need for multiple device support, or if you find a device that doesn\u0026rsquo;t behave!\nI also was able to make a prototype mini FSR pad for midi using a teensy LC and some tiny FSR sensors:\nThis worked a treat, so you can definitely get on to some tinkering if you want to make your own devices to play the game!\nThis driver works on Windows, Linux, RPi, Mac OS (intel) / Mac OS (M1) and Rockchip aarch64 SoCs    We are still working on latency and control, so let us know if you find anything quirky!\n Windows legacy input driver    There has also been work done on a small side part of the game, while we have been waiting for a fix from upstream in regards to the \u0026lsquo;polling/framerate\u0026rsquo; issue that a lot of folks have helping us diagnose for some time. The long and the short of the issue, it meant on some songs, the input would skew towards the update loop rather than honouring it\u0026rsquo;s timestamp, thus producing \u0026lsquo;spikes\u0026rsquo; on the scoring graph at the end of the song, and make a odd looking \u0026lsquo;stair\u0026rsquo; display on the scatter plot of the steps and judgements taken.\nTo resolve this while we\u0026rsquo;re waiting a fix, we have reimplemented the old legacy driver that was on 5.2/5.1 and adapted it for OutFox. This driver can be tempremental, but it seemed to behave with the devices we tested it with. If you tend to find that your input is affected with the message loop issue, you can set up the driver with the following instructions.\nYou will need to load up your preferences.ini in your save folder, locate the inputdrivers= part, and then make sure it looks like this inputdrivers=legacy,minisdl\n(if you wish to use the new portmidi driver as well you can use InputDrivers=legacy,minisdl,portmidi)\nThis will allow you to run the game with minimal resources, keeping vsync on, and should remove any previous issues of fps/rate/polling problems. When we have the fix from upstream, we\u0026rsquo;ll revisit and modernise this with the newer drivers and processes.\nOn the \u0026lsquo;test input\u0026rsquo; screen, you will see a new Window Handler \u0026lsquo;Aux\u0026rsquo; driver. This is just the driver that manages the window controls, maximises, fullscreens, etc, so no need to worry about it. This will also show you, that you have the correct drivers selected in the inputdrivers setting.\n Rate and Pitch Changes:    Due to an overwhelming set of requests, we have taken time to fix and modernise the rate/haste system which had been broken for a bit since this project began.\nPitch seemed to be a lottery (though we had not seen it work) and all the rate mod used to do was seemingly speed up the song with no other effect or option being honoured.\nSimilarly, we have moved the ratemod to the first screen of the song options - thanks to the stamina players that popped in to request this, and to mattm for saying that most wanted a speed AND pitch option, which we have called \u0026lsquo;both\u0026rsquo; internally to signify this change.\nThe new layout looks like so:\nWe have fixed the way the off/speed/pitch/speed and pitch options work, so they actually work. This took quite a bit of time to fix the internal pipelines for these, but the end effect is definitely fun. Thanks to Squirrel, Jousway and Jose for bringing this one up the pipeline to get it done for this release!\nTo ensure compatibility with legacy themes, the system \u0026lsquo;defaults\u0026rsquo; to how it was in 5.0.12, with a 0.01x increase, and being on the main menu as folks requested. This is a long overdue Quality of Life update for this, so we\u0026rsquo;re really pleased it\u0026rsquo;s done.\n KNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.9.9     ❕❌ ISSUE gh mode: Some charts have no real \u0026lsquo;standard\u0026rsquo; and will cause a crash when loaded into the game ❕❌ ISSUE techno/popn/gdgf/gddm/gh/para mode: Trying to use the sync audio screen will crash the game - Use dance to sync your game for now ❕❌ ISSUE gddm mode: We do not support the XA codec at this time, it\u0026rsquo;ll play silent. ❕❌ ISSUE beat/popn/gddm some early (pre2013) songs may play some sound samples / keysounds at the wrong speed   Full Changelog Follows:    ALL:    Mode Specific\n ❕✅ Fixed DTX Detection of track/lane sizes overflowing the notefield ❕✅ Fixed BMS/DTX/PMS Keysound iterator edge crash ❕✅ New!

Please find your save folder and delete the contents of /cache. This will make your first time run of 4.9.9 slightly longer as it has to rebuild the index, but it is to accommodate the new modes/setup etc. Please remember to restart the game after doing a cache build, so you do not have as many issues with memory management.  New (and some Old!) Modes Update Version 2    Following on from the last release, we have continued to improve and revamp the note system for the new modes, with Jousway taking the time to make available new types and styles available that were never before. This month fixes some omissions we made from the last release, which slipped through the testing teams.\n pump    We have fixed the scoring bug that was in the previous build, and thank you for those who took the time to report the issues. Keep in mind that Soundwaves still uses \u0026lsquo;dance\u0026rsquo; paradigms for scoring, but other themes that use different scoring systems based on \u0026lsquo;pump/piu\u0026rsquo; should work correctly now.\nThe tick-count has been tweaked to work correctly as there was a miscalculation in the offset math inherited from upstream. This now behaves as expected.\nGetting random misses on hold heads has been resolved as well as the holds with small tails (mini/micro holds).\nSupport for co-op charts has been added. 5 player is introduced with up to 10 players support, though the noteskins have not been prepared at this time. The numbers on the noteskins are separately labeled so with a few adjustments and extra assets you will be able to update any noteskin to work with co-op. Co-op charts made on StepF2/StepP1 should work on OutFox, however, better note types are currently being developed by Jousway so that there can be more than 3 real players defined. Stay tuned!\nThose of you who have reported that we still have a \u0026lsquo;superb\u0026rsquo; bug on holds, this will be fixed when we introduce the new piu mode - remember the pump mode is getting Quality of Life updates for now, before we move over to updating things properly in the future.\nMicro/Miniholds also do not trigger misses/cause a weird tick to happen anymore, and there also are no \u0026lsquo;phantom\u0026rsquo; mines in long (5+ measure) holds - this was an oddity which has been fixed now.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re still working on improving SF2/SP1 custom charts parsing. Except for a few charts, you can play the majority of content made for it on OutFox with no problems. As always, if you find any oddities make sure you report them to us!\n popn    There was also a reported issue where some of the channels (lanes) of the PMS 7 button mode were not parsing correctly, or were actually being missed completely, resulting in a chart \u0026lsquo;misplacing\u0026rsquo; green and blue lanes. This was due to Squirrel misreading the spec on how BMS98/PMS was transcribed and set up the function wrong. It is fixed in this release.\nWe also have added 18 lane mode (No PMS/(BME) File support yet though!)\nThank you to all of those that took the time to report this and to kick us into getting outfox into a proper BMS/PMS parser. There are still a few features missing from po-mu mode, but these will be added to the game as per the spec (see the table below for more information.)\npopn mode also had a few tweaks and adjustments this alpha mainly in how keysounds are loaded within the game. This should now mean the mode should be smoother overall.\nThanks to the channels being set right, we also are happy to announce another feature to \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; mode: 2 player! This was not available on the original client, but it did always irk us how there was never 2 player options other than 3 button battle. In a future update, there will be a battle mode for \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; but for now, enjoy the 2 player fun. We will finally be having a theme for \u0026lsquo;popn\u0026rsquo; in OutFox really soon, so this is finally a move from the \u0026lsquo;dance\u0026rsquo; centric era of the application\u0026rsquo;s past.\nHave some fun with mod files from dance on popn-four\nbeat will be getting some attention this next quarter!     para    We have given this mode a polish (and for those with an arcade cab, with 3 sensors doing nothing!) we added the \u0026lsquo;fabled\u0026rsquo; 360, or 8 sensor mode. This mode was designed for in the arcade for when the player twirls or turns, but was never actioned. The sensors for the back are actually there! This mode adds that, and for those who feel adventurous, we will be publishing some information on how to make your own 360 8 sensor panel controller in due course.\n taitai    Announcing our 15th mode!\nTaiTai is based off of a popular game where you hit a drum in it\u0026rsquo;s face. The game is horizontally based, with the notes travelling from right to left, and you hit the drum when the note gets to the receptor. The orange notes are for the inner part of the drum, and the blue ones are for the outer rim of the drum.\nFor the moment, some of the quirkier parts of this mode are a work in progress, bear with us as we also write new parsers for this mode. We plan to add support for the special note types and other effects in the game, as well as improve timing and other bits and pieces that are still yet to do.\nOnce more, we have no theme for this yet! (We are an alpha after all!) However, we will have a theme available for this soon that will give the mode polish and a playable feel.\nWe still have the scoring and timing system to finish, along with effects on double notes/taps and the \u0026lsquo;roll\u0026rsquo; notes which you hit as much as you can. Feel free to give it a run and let us know what you think!\nThere is a collection of noteskins including Shizuka, Crystal TaiTai and others.\nThe autogen for this mode has been rewritten by Jousway to include a more TaiTai aware selection of notes, so that we do not get odd holds/overlaps in things. Give it a try!\n gddm    This release sees the long awaited updates to our gddm mode!\nThe lane drawing has been fixed, so that notes or \u0026lsquo;chips\u0026rsquo; as they are referred to display correctly, and we have properly sorted out the \u0026lsquo;merged\u0026rsquo; lane support.\nWe have planned to \u0026lsquo;straddle\u0026rsquo; support for the DTXMania NX/Ver. K layouts for the specified channels from the documentation, as these appear to be the most popular branches of this. A detailed channel support list will follow later on.\nAs of this build we have fixed loading .DTX files and these support most of the DRUM based side of the loading, see the table below. This will be improved in time, as we get better knowledge of this system.\nWe also support the \u0026lsquo;combined\u0026rsquo; lane system which adds lane 2 and lane 3\u0026rsquo;s extra notes, and Real mode (again, REAL filenames are yet to be parsed as such, the engine makes a \u0026lsquo;guess\u0026rsquo; on this!)\ngddm still needs a lot of work, and optimisation before we will consider it \u0026lsquo;ready\u0026rsquo;, so do expect the odd quirk or weird behaviour, and let us know what you think/would like to see as we define the mode and it\u0026rsquo;s featureset and support. we will be working on the gdgf parser in the coming months so that the guitar/bass charts will work as well.\nWe do not support XA file decoding at this time, we are looking into options. If you have a dtx file with XA files contained, they will just be played as silence, but won\u0026rsquo;t crash the game.  We do support the #PAN and #VOLUME tags, (shoutout to Jous!) we managed to get this in before the release.

Makes it easier to find things you need, and please give us feedback if you feel a mode needs more representing/love!\n Mac OS builds are now signed!    We have finally passed all the requirements to be able to sign the binary, so this means no more xattr stuff anymore! we just act like any other application.\n Mode Status:     New Cross Platform MIDI Driver!    Due to the interest we had been getting from the past two alpha releases in the form of gddm and techno, several players that were not on windows did enquire about the possibility of there being a new MIDI driver available for Mac and Linux users to make use of for their midi fighters, e-drums, etc and we decided as a team to move forward and produce one.\nThe midi driver stands alone, there is no need to have any extra applications \u0026lsquo;translating\u0026rsquo; it to keystrokes, (unless you\u0026rsquo;re doing midi via an iphone or something like that of course), but native midi controllers work a treat. If you have a midi device and want to try this out, you will need to load up your preferences.ini in your save folder, locate the inputdrivers= part, and then make sure it looks like this inputdrivers=portmidi,SDL\nThis will allow the midi driver to load, and set up your device. We have currently coded it for a single device at a time, but do let us know if you feel there is a need for multiple device support, or if you find a device that doesn\u0026rsquo;t behave!\nI also was able to make a prototype mini FSR pad for midi using a teensy LC and some tiny FSR sensors:\nThis worked a treat, so you can definitely get on to some tinkering if you want to make your own devices to play the game!\nThis driver works on Windows, Linux, RPi, Mac OS (intel) / Mac OS (M1) and Rockchip aarch64 SoCs    We are still working on latency and control, so let us know if you find anything quirky!\n Windows legacy input driver    There has also been work done on a small side part of the game, while we have been waiting for a fix from upstream in regards to the \u0026lsquo;polling/framerate\u0026rsquo; issue that a lot of folks have helping us diagnose for some time. The long and the short of the issue, it meant on some songs, the input would skew towards the update loop rather than honouring it\u0026rsquo;s timestamp, thus producing \u0026lsquo;spikes\u0026rsquo; on the scoring graph at the end of the song, and make a odd looking \u0026lsquo;stair\u0026rsquo; display on the scatter plot of the steps and judgements taken.\nTo resolve this while we\u0026rsquo;re waiting a fix, we have reimplemented the old legacy driver that was on 5.2/5.1 and adapted it for OutFox. This driver can be tempremental, but it seemed to behave with the devices we tested it with. If you tend to find that your input is affected with the message loop issue, you can set up the driver with the following instructions.\nYou will need to load up your preferences.ini in your save folder, locate the inputdrivers= part, and then make sure it looks like this inputdrivers=legacy,minisdl\n(if you wish to use the new portmidi driver as well you can use InputDrivers=legacy,minisdl,portmidi)\nThis will allow you to run the game with minimal resources, keeping vsync on, and should remove any previous issues of fps/rate/polling problems. When we have the fix from upstream, we\u0026rsquo;ll revisit and modernise this with the newer drivers and processes.\nOn the \u0026lsquo;test input\u0026rsquo; screen, you will see a new Window Handler \u0026lsquo;Aux\u0026rsquo; driver. This is just the driver that manages the window controls, maximises, fullscreens, etc, so no need to worry about it. This will also show you, that you have the correct drivers selected in the inputdrivers setting.\n Rate and Pitch Changes:    Due to an overwhelming set of requests, we have taken time to fix and modernise the rate/haste system which had been broken for a bit since this project began.\nPitch seemed to be a lottery (though we had not seen it work) and all the rate mod used to do was seemingly speed up the song with no other effect or option being honoured.\nSimilarly, we have moved the ratemod to the first screen of the song options - thanks to the stamina players that popped in to request this, and to mattm for saying that most wanted a speed AND pitch option, which we have called \u0026lsquo;both\u0026rsquo; internally to signify this change.\nThe new layout looks like so:\nWe have fixed the way the off/speed/pitch/speed and pitch options work, so they actually work. This took quite a bit of time to fix the internal pipelines for these, but the end effect is definitely fun. Thanks to Squirrel, Jousway and Jose for bringing this one up the pipeline to get it done for this release!\nTo ensure compatibility with legacy themes, the system \u0026lsquo;defaults\u0026rsquo; to how it was in 5.0.12, with a 0.01x increase, and being on the main menu as folks requested. This is a long overdue Quality of Life update for this, so we\u0026rsquo;re really pleased it\u0026rsquo;s done.\n KNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.9.9     ❕❌ ISSUE gh mode: Some charts have no real \u0026lsquo;standard\u0026rsquo; and will cause a crash when loaded into the game ❕❌ ISSUE techno/popn/gdgf/gddm/gh/para mode: Trying to use the sync audio screen will crash the game - Use dance to sync your game for now ❕❌ ISSUE gddm mode: We do not support the XA codec at this time, it\u0026rsquo;ll play silent. ❕❌ ISSUE beat/popn/gddm some early (pre2013) songs may play some sound samples / keysounds at the wrong speed   Full Changelog Follows:    ALL:    Mode Specific\n ❕✅ Fixed DTX Detection of track/lane sizes overflowing the notefield ❕✅ Fixed BMS/DTX/PMS Keysound iterator edge crash ❕✅ New!

Please find your save folder and delete the contents of /cache. This will make your first time run of 4.9.8 slightly longer as it has to rebuild the index, but it is to accomodate the new modes/setup etc.     This alpha has tweaked the way the delta clock works, take care to read the information below!    If you find that your histogram is slightly skewed one side or the other, like the example below, please take a moment to go into options -\u0026gt; audio offsync and recalibrate your offset. Since 4.9.7GG we have slightly adjusted the renderer pipeline to optimise how we deal with frames within the Kernel Timer of the OS. This is to prepare for new sound/render drivers coming in the near future, but as we\u0026rsquo;ve found with a lot in this game, baby steps to fix little blockers before we do major updates. We also have removed more of the Rage Engine in favour of modern mathematics algorithms, and this has needed a slight tweak to the order on how we draw things.\nThis example above shows the mismatched offset from 4.9.7GG\nUsing the sound offset menu to sync your system, you can get a much tighter response, and this will enable you to chase those fantastics!\nPlease do the sound calibration in dance mode! This may not be available in your custom theme, so do it before you swap over!     PLEASE NOTE F2 TO RELOAD SCRIPTS HAS MOVED BACK TO THE F2 KEY!!! (for now as it will be a modders debug menu in the future)     New (and some Old!) Modes Update.    This (slightly delayed) month\u0026rsquo;s update beings some inner reworkings to the gameplay and modes available to play. We are listing them here for your awareness so you can help test them with us, but they will be officially announced in a future release, so please be aware these new modes ARE NOT COMPLETE, and DO NOT REFLECT the final finished versions for their type, due to the fact most of them have no dedicated theme or style setup as they\u0026rsquo;ve not been touched in 7-15 years. We are going to stop the trend of \u0026lsquo;adding new stuff then doing nothing with it\u0026rsquo; that was so common in the project we are formed from, so that is not going to continue with OutFox. All modes support all the modding systems that dance does, so for those of you that wish to explore, have at it! Most of these modes are sadly neglected and have been without support or a maintainer for upwards of a decade, so be a touch sympathetic to them if you decide to take the time to explore, they will be given the love they deserve.\nFirstly, lets talk about the new modes. These are still a work in progress, but are functional for you to experience.\nIf you wish to autogen charts, you can go to Options -\u0026gt; System Settings -\u0026gt; Project OutFox Settings -\u0026gt; Autogen Steps to ON. Restart your game, and the autogen will make some charts for you to play the new modes. For a better experience, go to the \u0026lsquo;modifiers\u0026rsquo; menu on player options (when you have selected a song, double tap start) and select super shuffle as it will rebalance the notes across the new modes, instead of favouring the left hand side. We will be fixing the auto-generator in a future release, but this works well for now for you to at least have a play.\nThe new keybindings for the modes will be updated shortly on our wiki.\ngddm    This is a 9 panel (and 10 panel) drum mode based off of the DTX drum kits and inspired by DrumMania, that supports Midi drums and original controllers. Midi support is only on Windows at this time, but we will have a working driver for all platforms by the end of the summer. Gameplay is played on drums, (or keyboard!) and follows the drum use in a chart.\nThe theming for this mode is incomplete, as is common with a lot of the project at the moment, but again there is enough there to play and experiment with! The editor can be used to create charts, as the new DTX loader for this mode is being built and will be made available in the future. If you have comments or thoughts about this mode, let us know.\n gdgf    This mode is based off of the 3 fret/lane guitar mode inspired from Guitarfreaks, however, we have chosen to expand it to include the 5 lane (and a new exclusive 6 lane mode!) for OutFox\u0026rsquo;s inspired mode.\ngdgf uses much tighter timing than the other guitar mode, so take a moment and test yourself if you\u0026rsquo;re feeling brave! This mode will use the new DTX loader when it\u0026rsquo;s complete, but you can also use Autogen or the editor to have a play with some charts in the meantime. Again, we have yet to build a theme for this mode, so please bear with us while we create new stuff for these modes.\n gh    This is a 5 lane (and 6 lane coming soon!) mode based off of a collection of popular games that used a guitar styled controller to press frets and strum along to bass and guitar parts of a song. We have added a new .CHART and .MIDI loader, and new note types and internal changes so this mode works without being squished around the old 4K dance engine side.\nThere will be new theme and broken down menu options for this mode in due course, when we introduce a new experience for those who wish to try it.\nWe support Jam Mode where one player can be one play type, and the other can backup or be rhythm. This has the benefit of adding variety into the play, and allows you both to play different parts of the song at the same time. You can do this on several of the styles. One thing to note! You should go into the player options when selecting a song and ensure that you set the modifications to Constant BPM, and set the speed mod to around C450 to emulate the speed from clone hero or similar. At the bottom of this menu, if you go to effects and scroll down towards the bottom, you will also see a new selection of modifiers available exclusively in gh mode: The evaluation and results screens will be reworked in the next version, so ignore the fact it\u0026rsquo;s counting calories and pretending to be dance mode!\n popn    This mode has been around for a very long time, but has not really had any support or been looked at since before 2010. It was side-lined into the BMS loader, which actually broke a lot of the needed changes PMS actually uses, and as a result most PMS files with 7 or 9 lanes, would be added to the game as beat 10 lane or 14 lane charts. It was known there were issues with this mode, but we were not aware it was broken as bad as it was.\nSquirrel would like to thank the anonymous japanese player we\u0026rsquo;ll name \u0026ldquo;竹 (Take)\u0026rdquo; girl, for reporting this bug, who wanted to play Nitro\u0026rsquo;s PMS chart of the song on OutFox, but experienced the issue above, and there were also issues with how the keysounds were being loaded for this song in popn mode and she took the time to give a very detailed report in DM on discord, but deleted her account before we could see her username. I thank you a lot for the report, and if you ever read this, please come and say hi in our discord!\nSquirrel took the time to investigate it and it was decided to code a new modernised PMS loader to the game, which now correctly loads PMS songs as they should be. This also removes the oddity and edge crashes when anyone wished to play popn mode on OutFox. This song, \u0026lsquo;竹\u0026rsquo; (Bamboo) charted by Nitro was used as a testbed to debug and ensure it properly works correctly in the game, so we took time to fix it so it would be recognised as a 9 Button PMS file. I\u0026rsquo;d like to thank Nitro for charting this as we would never have had the report which meant we could fix 13 year old bugs on our PMS and BMS loaders, and to 竹 girl for taking the time to bring it to our attention so we could fix this properly and have a restored mode. You can find them at https://twitter.com/NitroX72 - Thanks again Nitro!\nWe also have added 2 new noteskins from our community member Daniel, which really add to the style of the game. We have cat, cat-retro, bun, and bun retro!\n(The theme will be complete for the summer)\nWe have taken some older PMS files from the talented folks at Colorful Channel that also did not parse and work correctly, and these now do show up and play as expected once again.\nAs per the BMS/PMS specification, we also have added for the first time, new #BGA channel 06 (POOR), 07 (BG2) and 0A (LAYER 2) support, and will code these effectively when the theme for this mode is complete. We also support the missing LN# (Long Notes) that have never been in this game before, as well as the #ITEM channels.\nWe will continue to adapt and add the missing functionality from PMS moving forward, now it has it\u0026rsquo;s own loader. This loader now also supports 3 lane (in preparation for battle support), 4 lane for hello pop\u0026rsquo;n (ハロー！ポップンミュージック) and 5/7 lanes for pop\u0026rsquo;n portable (ポップンミュージックポータブル). These have been coded and added to the game, with the 3 lane awaiting new PMS code and subtype item code to be added before it will work. There is also a rumoured 18 lane mode, which I\u0026rsquo;m trying to research. If you know any sources/samples/charts, let Squirrel know!\n beat    Just adding this here to show the \u0026lsquo;miss\u0026rsquo; or #BGA06 POOR layer in action. As is typical, we have no theme\u0026hellip;\nThis needs coding and the proper layout supported, as moving forward we also want to add and support the missing BMS specification as well as add new support via BMSON in the future. It is just part of our pledge to support new and interesting modes moving forwards that we hope folks will enjoy!\n techno    We have added the missing 9panel/18panel support from this mode, as requested by a few folks. There was enough demand to add the extra panel. You can create charts for this on the editor, as we do not believe there are any sims for this yet!\n18 panel example gameplay is here: This mode requires good mobility and that you don\u0026rsquo;t use too much polish as slippery pads can lead to falls!\nA Techno 18 panel in the wild, with a cat token collector!\n Changes to Default Theme Pause Menu    This one is important. Due to the need to change the system for the new BGA/Layer system for the BMS/PMS/DTX etc mode support, we have had to adjust the methodology in how the pause menu is drawn by the theme. On the default theme, the hold escape to give up option has been swapped to give an instant display of the menu. Older/OutFox supported themes that are specifically for dance will experience no change here, as we have kept backwards compatibility for them. We will look at re-adding this \u0026lsquo;hold\u0026rsquo; option in the future perhaps if it can be sorted within the new modes.\n ** New Feature **\nHold/Roll Tail Type - Lift    This function will add a tail note to all holds and lifts, making it so that you have to lift your foot/finger/etc from the end of a hold. This adds a little bit of a challenge for files, and can help with training for foot positions for players that wish to progress to higher chart difficulties. The benefits of removing the foot at the correct time can enable better preparedness for upcoming streams or any technical that the chart may have, which could be lost because of inaccurate foot removal from holds or rolls.\nOn rolls, they have the same behaviour as before, however, the last lift will be done on the \u0026lsquo;beat\u0026rsquo; of that roll. Once more, this trains for better foot stance and movement when a roll ends especially for stamina play. The player will be recorded a normal note \u0026lsquo;miss\u0026rsquo; if the tail lift is not performed at the correct moment.\nThese modifiers are available in all game modes, however, not all noteskins will have the support for them, and some themers will need to add these to their player options menus if they wish to add the availability to their theme.\n KNOWN ISSUES: Alpha 4.9.8     ❕❌ ISSUE gh mode: Some charts have no real \u0026lsquo;standard\u0026rsquo;

You will need to set UseOldJoystickMapping=0 so the game will initialise the XInput controller driver alongside your Python board.\nThis preference only currently supports the Python23IO driver, but will be expanded to Reflex and other drivers in the future.

Nvidia 460+ Driver Issues + Windows HotFix!    There has been a flurry of bug reports due to the new GeForce Experience based drivers moving into 460. There are some quite fundamental changes in this driver that have affected our LowLevelWindow system, and the way we draw. The latter will be fixed over the coming months, so we can be proactive and fix the issue before it becomes a game breaking situation. There is no way to \u0026lsquo;force\u0026rsquo; a bit per pixel or bpp in this version, as it\u0026rsquo;s being moved into a different function, that we will re-expose in the next alpha. This has no affect on gameplay or mode changes in the game, however it means if you\u0026rsquo;re on a system we consider historic (\u0026lt;1999) or vintage (2000 - 2007), you may need to force the settings in the preference.ini to set your \u0026lsquo;texture color depth\u0026rsquo; to 16. as always if you have any questions or need help, do not hesitate to reach out to us in our discord server https://discord.gg/hSHPAU37t8\nWe are still working on restoring some settings changed in the operating system in the 20H2, which can limit frame rate, force your GPU to change delta clock accuracy and even affect the kernel poll/tick rate. These issues will be resolved in a future update as we find out more from Windows Dev support/MSDN.\nNvidia Specific Fixes\n ❕✅ Fixed Crash with Generating Avatars for profiles due to texture format ❕✅ Fixed Crash with Changing VSync via F3 + 7 (Thanks Shockdude) ❕✅ Fixed Race Condition Crash with debugoverlay (Thanks Shockdude) ❕✅ Fixed Crash with Setting Refresh Rate (Thanks Moneko, Moru) ❕✅ Fixed Crash with Paraph AMV Heavy Modfiles causing a Texture overflow (Thanks Moru, Paraph) ❕✅ Fixed Crash with Paraph AMV Heavy Modfiles causing a Context Splice problem (Thanks Moru, Paraph) ❕✅ Fixed Crash with Paraph AMV Heavy Modfiles not clearing correctly on song close (Thanks Moru, Paraph) ❕✅ Fixed Crash caused in method to intialise the OpenGL and GLAD render pipes ❕✅ Forced OpenGL \u0026lt;4.1 as the new driver is unstable on anything newer at this time ❕✅ Fixed Crash with Theme changes from default ❕✅ Add Object Flags to prevent crash with some of the more exotic mod files  StepMania Random Number Generation    Since the beginning of this project, we have had a few bug reports about the \u0026lsquo;random\u0026rsquo; number generator in the game not being\u0026hellip; well, random at all. We have been spending some of the time in the downtime over the holiday to actually look into this and we discovered that the system was indeed not performing remotely as designed, and has been broken since late 2004. The main bug report was #22 and #59 by @PCBoyGames and well, we discovered that on further investigation, those bugs were caused to a misinterpretation of the way that the random generator was designed and how it should be used in getting/acquiring a random number.\nSuperShuffle/Blender and Soft_Shuffle    This was further crushed in it\u0026rsquo;s delivery with shuffle and super shuffle, and anything really that relied on these broken systems. To resolve them we have removed the 1999 era code and modernised it to current modern standards. This has the benefit of completely fixing SuperShuffle (Blender on old versions) and now the distribution is as expected, not to the left.\nThis has the side effect of making the randomness different for each player so bear this in mind if you\u0026rsquo;re going to play! We will add a Mirror function for this so Player 1 = Player 2 in the future.\nPORTAL on the Music Wheel    Those of you that use the default theme, we have returned a feature that was oddly missing on 5.3, and that was the Portal slot next to Roulette and Random.\nWhat is Portal? Portal will pick at random from an open folder/group and if you move on it and away from it it will select a different song. If you close your folder so none are open, then portal will pick at random from your whole collection for that mode.\nExtended Mode    Most Played should now spawn songs, I sadly have a low level of played songs due to this being a development build, but you can get the general gist of how this system works.\nFolder Courses now spawn a collection as expected, and should be different ONI Mode    With the new random modes now working as expected, this has been a welcome quality of life for ONI mode: Artist songs are now shuffled as expected!\nEndless Mode    This mode has never been given any love so far from the dev team, so much so even the layout hasn\u0026rsquo;t been finalised! We will look at fixing this and making this mode consistent in the future, so forgive the \u0026lsquo;default\u0026rsquo; looking layout.\nRandom Attacks    There were issues with how this methodology was supposed to actually work, as it likely has been broken for so long. Well in this release, we have unique per player random attacks for that extra challenge! The text file RandomAttacks.txt in your /Data file can be filled with fiendish ideas that can help or hinder a player, so do take a moment to be naughty (or nice!) and populate that file with some cool effects!\nWith the removal of the legacy code and the new updates, we can happily say that we have squashed 37 upstream bugs that have been around since the SM 3.0 era.\nRandom Number Generator Specifc Fixes\n ❕✅ Fixed Edge Case Crash with random background movies when only one movie was present ❕✅ Fixed Random Movies only selecting 0, 1, or 2, movies in a folder ❕✅ Fixed Random Backgrounds only selecting 0, 1, or 2 backgrounds in a folder ❕✅ Fixed Random Movies showing the same movie on song start ❕✅ Fixed Random Backgrounds showing the same movie on song start ❕✅ Fixed Course Generation on Extended Mode ❕✅ Fixed Course Generation on Oni Mode ❕✅ Fixed Course Generation on Endless Mode ❕✅ Fixed Course Generation on Survival Mode ❕✅ Fixed Shuffle Mode on the Music Wheel for Roulette ❕✅ Fixed Random Stage Seed generation ❕✅ Fixed GameState Seed generation ❕✅ Fixed Seed generation in NoteDataUtil, Allowing for better AutoGen ❕✅ Fixed Kickbox Autogen ❕✅ Fixed Song Shuffle being pushed to duplicates in SongManager ❕✅ Add new RandomInt function to allow for course generation without crashing ❕✅ Add new RandomFloat function for equivalent support for older content using it ❕✅ Fixed Math.Random being linked to a function that didn\u0026rsquo;t work as designed ❕✅ Fixed Random Attacks only selecting a maximum of 5 different during a song ❕✅ Fixed Random Attacks not actually being Random ❕✅ Fixed Random Attacks edge crash on Raspberry pi/M1 due to bad math function ❕✅ Fixed Random Attacks not completely loading the text file and making attacks available to the players ❕✅ Fixed Jukebox Mode not using the full available mode song selection ❕✅ Fixed Jukebox Mode not using the correct random mode for mod selection during playback ❕✅ Fixed Portal Mode not accessing folder based songs ❕✅ Fixed Portal Mode not selecting the available mode song list ❕✅ Fixed Edge Crash on Portal Mode with 2 Players selected ❕✅ Fixed Jitter Generation on BitMapText ❕✅ Fixed Distortion Generation on BitMapText ❕✅ Fixed Array Overflow where returned index was out of bounds ❕✅ Fixed now defunct RandomGen calls in course generation as they are no longer required ❕✅ Fixed bit underflow when Song Index is NULL  PLEASE NOTE F2 TO RELOAD SCRIPTS HAS MOVED TO THE INSERT KEY!!!

Nvidia 460+ Driver Issues + Windows HotFix!    There has been a flurry of bug reports due to the new GeForce Experience based drivers moving into 460. There are some quite fundamental changes in this driver that have affected our LowLevelWindow system, and the way we draw. The latter will be fixed over the coming months, so we can be proactive and fix the issue before it becomes a game breaking situation.

This is to protect you having settings or menus operate as both players at once, which could be a pain!\nWhen you are in a game mode, you can add two players and then turn the option on: Press and Hold F3, then press 5\nYou will then be in BAO mode, and can play mod files! (You can find a collection of ported and original files from our community)\n(Screen Select Music - Setting both at once mode on)\nYou can also select menu options and settings in BAO mode for the song, but do bear in mind many mod files set their own speed mods and noteskins:\nYou can then play the game as one player, but it will fill in for two!\nThings to note!\n If you are player 2, then player 1 will be your \u0026lsquo;ghost\u0026rsquo; and vice versa If there is a mini-game in the mod file, which checks for individual player input, we will not override this with BAO! (This is to mirror NitG Behaviour, and is as designed) The player you are not playing on will be disqualified, and it\u0026rsquo;s score won\u0026rsquo;t be saved, even if it is displayed in the evaluation screen You can turn off and on BAO during a song, using F3 + 5 BAO will be reset when leaving the Select Music Screen, or if the System Switch is pressed  On evaluation, you will note player 1 matches player 2:\nWe also have some different pages on the evaluation page - if you press left or right you will change \u0026lsquo;page\u0026rsquo; to reveal more details.\nThe scatter graph in this alpha is drawn a lot more efficiently, which should prevent the slowdown when looking at many presses.\nThe \u0026lsquo;histogram\u0026rsquo; is another highly requested feature for outfox, adapted from the features from https://github.com/Simply-Love/Simply-Love-SM5, we draw it differently in OutFox, as we have the different timing windows.\nNew Actor Multi Vertex Draw options!    This alpha also introduces a few new options for controlling your draw commands when creating an actormultivertex(). There were some issues we found in the methodology used in the older code which sometimes allowed the game to fall back to CPU based rendering/calculation for drawing some objects and lines, causing stuttering and arrow lag in screen gameplay, and would cause odd slowdowns in the evaluation screen (as noted by many of our stamina players, when playing marathon mode!)\nWe added two new draw options, and optimised some of the older modes to be less heavy on the game while drawing effects or UI objects.\nNote the VPF (Vertices per Frame) Count. Higher counts mean higher loads on the system: (Before with drawmode_quadstrip) The draw mode has been changed to just use points, dropping the value considerably. (After with the new drawmode_points) Another thing that can be decided in the Lua command is the state of the points, which allow for square or circle points: Square: Circle: New lua commands: self:SetDrawState{Mode=\u0026quot;DrawMode_Points\u0026quot;}:SetVertices(verts)\nNew Draw Modes, we have DrawMode_Points and DrawMode_Lines!\nself:SetPointState(boolean) (so false or true - Alias the Points. if the size is too big, or it is not supported on the GPU\u0026rsquo;s driver, it will be drawn as a square, but won\u0026rsquo;t crash.)\nexample: circle: self:SetPointState(true) square: self:SetPointState(false)\nresizable points: self:SetPointSize(float) - Size in PIXELS of the point to draw. This will often round to a whole number on older systems, but most cards will use subpixel sampling to keep these as designed. For better performance, use a whole number, so 6.0.\nExample: self:SetPointSize(10.5)\nThese are called in your actormultivertex like so:\nlocal amv = Def.ActorMultiVertex { OnCommand=function(self) self:SetDrawState{Mode=\u0026#34;DrawMode_Points\u0026#34;}:SetVertices(verts) self:SetPointSize(10.5) self:SetPointState(1) end } Example drawn with thin DrawMode_Lines: Oh, we built a Windows XP build for those with cabinets.\nTEXTURE FONT GENERATOR V0.33 https://github.com/TeamRizu/Texture-Font-Generator-2020-Squirrel     ❕✅🐲📝 Added Hebrew (Thanks Snil4 for the request) ❕✅🐲📝 Set the \u0026lsquo;example\u0026rsquo; glyph to be 0000058 so it is usually displayed by obscure fonts.

Apologies for the Delay on this release. The changelog for 4.8.6 and 4.9.0 are together in this update.\nWe have sorted out the issues with the misunderstanding of the StepMania project name and this will return to the project for the next alpha, with a re-brand. It was all done amicably, and it had to be acted upon due to it being reported, so no problems there.\nFonts and Language:    This month sees a pretty big revamp to the font system used in OutFox. Due to the numerous issues we have had reported to us since our project began, (missing symbols, missing characters, missing language support, missing Korean and Japanese support, etc), We have rewritten the font maps.\nWhat this means for you? - Well, the fonts will be sharper as they are newer now, and you can generate the correct fonts for theming and such for OutFox in the future. We have a new repository for the Texture Font Generator which is a side project from @Scraticus and @Hanubeki to bring more charmaps to the game. These can be regenerated to support 5.0/5.1 and even 3.9/ITG era with a bit of work. If you do generate new fonts, please check out the guide that will be up on the MoonDance site shortly. We also have revamped the fonts that are used by mod files to be sharper and to add backwards support for the new fonts. (Beware of [main] duplication causing squares to be displayed by the game!). There is a new release of the Texture Font Generator, which includes new euro support, and legacy mapping generation for prior versions of StepMania.\nTEXTURE FONT GENERATOR V0.2 / OutFox Alpha 4.9.0 -     ❕✅🐲📝 Fixed Missing Korean Basic Characters #109 (Thanks AngledLuffa!) ❕✅🐲 Fixed Missing Symbol Characters from Kanji ❕✅🐲 Fixed Missing Characters from Korean Hangul ❕✅🐲 Fixed Missing Characters from Kanji JIS ❕✅🐲 Fixed Missing Characters from Kanji Hojo ❕✅🐲 Fixed Missing Characters from Kanji GBK for Traditional Chinese ❕✅🐲 Fixed Missing Characters from Cyrillic and Extended Latin ❕✅🐲 Regenerated outline fonts for the theme and mods ❕✅🐲 Added Characters from Legacy maps - (ASCII/CP1252/ISO8859) ❕✅🐲 Fixed Build system on windows 10, but the MFC system needs a bit of hacking - compiled binaries are available to grab  We have also have had to add a new set of Lua Commands for this alpha. (See #121) We have been aware of this for some time, but delayed the alpha a touch so they were ready.    For backwards compatibility string.upper() and string.lower() have not been touched.\nThe new lua commands in this build are ToUpper() and ToLower().\nTo display upper case text - done on the troublesome polish characters: Text=ToUpper(Screen.String(\u0026quot;Start To Join\u0026quot;)) produces:\nWe even can do a proper UTF friendly lower case as well: Text=ToLower(Screen.String(\u0026quot;Start To Join\u0026quot;)) USING ALT+ENTER TO SWITCH IN AND OUT OF FULLSCREEN:    We have added the option to all operating systems to be able to access this function, but be warned: the SDL window does not scale modes which your Monitor does not support in fullscreen. It will draw a border around the window if the mode is not a suitable mode. You can find these modes in the log.txt, as SDL is kind enough to display everything supported there.\nWe have allowed the other OS\u0026rsquo;s this function for familiarity and the fact we didn\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;d work on mac/linux, but it did.\nALL:\n ❕✅ Set locale for the game to use en_US.UTF-8 for now - This will be extended soon ❕✅ Fix Missing font paths in the default theme ❕✅ Remove Lua macro which did nothing to the font display ❕✅📝 Fixed Bug with BeginnerHelper hiding/unhiding backgrounds causing unwanted behaviour. #104 \u0026amp; #105 (Thanks @SilentTempest83 !) ❕✅📝 Fixed crash with resizing window on some older windows versions (7/8) #102 (Thanks @Emilovesdoubles) ❕✅📝 Fixed Lirocode in Hold / Roll anchors #106 (Thanks @JapanYoshi!) ❕✅📝 Fixed Lirocode in Note colours and 24th\u0026rsquo;s being wrong. #111 \u0026amp; #112 (Thanks @AngledLuffa!) ❕✅📝 Fixed missing Narumi Mascot avatar images not being available as usable avatars in game #115 (Thanks @Joehuu!) ❕✅📝 Added Precision Dance Pad config entry to our GameControllerDB #117 (Thanks @AngledLuffa!) ❕✅ Fixed Timing windows for ITG/ITG Advanced and ECFA ❕✅ Fixed Alt+Enter leaving weird screen blackness on 75% of the space ❕✅ Fixed lua timing tables and optimised the loading method ❕✅📝 Fixed bug with toasties loading on the Machine Sync causing an AV (Thanks @JapanYoshi!) ❕✅📝 Fixed bug with left over commands being available to the Machine Sync system causing edge crashes (Thanks @JapanYoshi!) ❕✅📝 Fixed issue with missing UTF string conversion on the loading window (Thanks @Hanubeki / @JapanYoshi!) ❕✅📝 Added correct font (Code2000) support in loading window (Thanks @Hanubeki / @JapanYoshi!) ❕✅ Added preview to progress bar on screenselectmusic ❕✅ Fixed audio preview on song select #65 (Thanks @SHRMP0!) ❕✅ Fixed font presentation for soundwaves and default/fallback ❕✅ Fixed missing/incorrect font redirection files ❕✅ Fixed missing constructors on ActorFrameTexture ❕✅🐲 Beginning of making SM Locale Aware ❕✅🐲 Fix overflow on font index now we are using proper UTF-8 ❕✅🐲 Fix archaic practice on wide strings in font manager ❕✅🐲 Fix arithmetic overflow in rageutil preventing correct bytecode allocation ❕✅ Fix table indexing for high score entries overwriting previous results being shown ❕✅ Rename the 5.3 default noteskin to reinstate the 5.0 default for backwards compatibility support ❕✅ Make minimenu rows place on native position  Windows:\n ❕✅🐲📝 Removed potential crash on invalid DPI scaling detection - part of #88 (Thanks AngledLuffa!) ❕✅🐲 Fixed Alt+Enter not being able to leave full-screen causing the need for a restart ❕✅ Fixed uninstaller missing shortcuts due to windows 1903 update  Linux:\n ❕✅🐲 Fixed Alt+Enter not being able to leave full-screen  MacOSX:\n ❕✅🐲 NEW FEATURE: Added Alt-Enter full-screen switch ❕✅🐲 Fixed missing locale selection for \u0026ldquo;LC_ALL\u0026rdquo; causing a crash  ARM/ARM64: (Raspberry Pi etc)\n ❕✅🐲 NEW FEATURE: Added Alt-Enter full-screen switch ❕✅🐲 Fixed EGL initialisation on RPi 3B/4 trying to call the wrong driver ❕✅🐲 Fixed missing locale selection for \u0026ldquo;LC_ALL\u0026rdquo; causing a crash  Community Content:    Colours\n ✅ Dark Mode by infinitephantasm ✅ Chaos by moruzerinho6 ✅ Ice by PCBoyGames ✅ Wave by AppleArcade120  Translations\n ✅ Translations updated from Moru, SHRMP0 and SheepyChris (Brazilian Portuguese) ✅ Translations updated from MoNeko (Polish) ✅ Translations updated from Hanubeki (Japanese) ✅ Translations updated from Jose_Varela (Spanish) ✅ Translations updated from Daniel Rotwind (German) ✅ Translations updated from Ksempac (French)  (The \u0026lsquo;source\u0026rsquo; code below is the reporting issues template, it is not the source for OutFox)\n"},{"id":15,"href":"/releases/A4.8.5/","title":"OutFox Alpha 4.8.5 Build","parent":"Release History","content":"Release Date: 19th September 2020    \u0026ldquo;A Change is Afoot!\u0026rdquo;    Please note if your Download did not include HF in the title, download the en.ini and put it in your installation folder at the following path    windows: (X:\\Outfoxfolder\\Appearance\\Themes_fallback\\Languages) macosx: (Outfoxfolder\\Appearance\\Themes_fallback\\Languages)\nOr just download the HF version now we have repackaged.

Due to windows updates, (and Ubuntu updates) that have directly affected several of our users, we have taken the time to bring forward our plans to fix this sooner rather that later.\nWhat this means to you, our players. You now have a choice of using the XInput which will be enabled by default, (and has been the norm since alpha 4.5) which gives the familiar buttons on the XBox controller. We have added a new controller option row in the \u0026lsquo;Experimental Settings\u0026rsquo; which will allow easy change, you will need to reboot your game to reinitialise the input system, but we will make this a non-game reset option in a future update. There is also a preference you can edit which is called UseOldJoystickMapping setting this to 0 sets the XInput mode, and setting this to 1 enables the legacy (HIDAPI) mode for your controller or pad.\nYou will likely need to check your offset for this update, if you are swapping modes, as some controllers behave slightly different in legacy/XInput. This is true especially of custom Arduino pads, so take time to remember to test this.\nIf you use older controllers, please ensure they are plugged in BEFORE you start the game. Because we do not depend on DirectX anymore, we need to initialise the system on game start. We are looking into this, but once the system is live, controllers can be added and removed as normal. We really do not want to go back to DInput7 or DInput8 as Microsoft is really punishing use of these system and will remove them outright eventually.\nKeyboard players can use either method, this update fixed a couple of awry driver update issues on steelseries/Corsair keyboards to fix their polling issue, so you can play as normal.\nIf you have an SMX 4k/5k/pump pad, you can use either mode, but some players have mentioned that legacy \u0026lsquo;feels tighter\u0026rsquo; than XInput for this pad. Give it a try and let us know your thoughts.\nThis new mode allows for more than 4 controllers (which XInput is limited to by design), and does not require a mapping for the gamecontrollerdb.txt file which XInput pads require. This new mode allows the older Joystick path to run, which is based on HIDAPI, thus giving us a greater level of controller support than ever before. If your controller does not show up in OutFox, or has become troublesome since the operating system updates, this is the mode for you. If you have any issues with the new system (bear in mind, you WILL need to go to Key mapping and map all the buttons for your controller to their actions. YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE CONTROLLER MAPPING WITH THIS MODE!\nThe legacy mode returns to a slightly more familiar system from 5.1/5.0 so those of you with particularly troublesome controllers will no longer have issues. The ParaParaParadise Controller prefers to be on legacy. So if you use OutFox for Para/ParaStar/EKS-D remember to set this in your game, and restart. The PPP Controller needs to be plugged in BEFORE you start the game, due to how windows operates now. This is true for Ubuntu also. Mac OSX now also properly supports this controller.\nOn the subject of ParaPara Paradise, this month has seen a lot of work and collaboration to finally fix some of the glaring issues for this mode. We will continue to do this for all our modes, so look out for updates!\nParaPara Paradise mode has been given a swathe of fixes:     ❕✅ Fixed Noteskin loading on PPP mode ❕✅ Fixed missing theme elements on PPP mode ❕✅ Added new timing windows for PPP mode, which match the PS2/2nd Mix games ❕✅ Added new judgement names for PPP mode to match PS2/2nd Mix ❕✅ Added new Tick hit support - This allows for a hit if the sensor is triggered, as per the original games ❕✅ Added new Hold Tick Hit support - Fixes a long overdue bug in holds on PPP mode. ❕✅ Added new column style \u0026lsquo;active\u0026rsquo; when a sensor is triggered, to closer match the original games ❕✅ Added 2 player support for PPP mode ❕✅ Fixed PPP controller buttons not being recognised in game ❕✅ Added new default noteskin for PPP mode ❕✅ Added new Jara noteskin for PPP mode ❕✅ Fixed evaluation screen elements causing an edge case crash ❕✅ Fixed how the game records play details to be more accurate to the original play experience. ❕✅ Fixed Rate mode being set to a weird value ❕✅ Fixed Speed Mod. For accurate arcade experience, use A or C mod, between 100-300, we feel the sweet spot is 100-150 ❕✅ Fixed missing gameplay elements  We hope you all enjoy the new revamped Para Mode, and remember it\u0026rsquo;s also playable on MacOS fully for the first time! If you have any feedback or questions please do not hesitate to contact us on the discord!\nNew Loading Window     ❕✅🐲 New loading song error checking - The log will tell you about bad songs ❕✅🐲 New loading window system ❕✅🐲 Support UTF-8 on new loading window ❕✅🐲 New themeable loading window ❕✅🐲 Custom Font loading support ❕✅🐲 New font rendering  This version sees the launch of a new loading window, which has plagued the game since 2007. We plan to use this new window for more features in the future, and it will become fully themeable for those of you that wish to modify it. It is cross platform so replaces the legacy Linux Loader, and the horribly bugged MacOSX loader. The other good thing about this mode is when you load songs, it will check your audio files for availability. What this means, if the file is corrupted or damaged, or just unable to be loaded by the game, you will get a notice in your log file. For ease of viewing, you can scan the games songs with the new version, then check out info.txt in your /logs folder. if you have any damaged songs or corrupt mp3s etc, they will be logged here. An example from my own simfile collection:\nWARNING: Sound file /AdditionalSongs/parapara/Big O/Big O.ogg couldn't be opened: . Please check it is not corrupted and redownload the file.\nWe hope you find this a welcome addition, as it will prevent some sudden crashing or silence being played in the song wheel. This feature will be worked on in the future, so if you have any ideas please throw them our way! Sometimes the window will look like it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;locked up\u0026rsquo; on Windows - this is just the SSC cache being generated! Give it a moment and it\u0026rsquo;ll sort itself out, it only does it once.\nWe have plans to allow the online patcher and for configurations to be changed/set up for the future, so I\u0026rsquo;m hoping it is stable for you all and works as designed.\nNew MP3 Driver:     ❕✅ Removed libMAD and it\u0026rsquo;s dependencies ❕✅ Added new dr_mp3 MP3 Driver (clean for closed source phase) ❕✅ Added new libmpeg123 MP3 Driver (not in repo but available for open source phase) ❕✅🐲 Fixed internal Threads overflow ❕✅🐲 Fixed internal buffer sizes ❕✅🐲 Set modern system settings to allow transition  This has been in the background for some time. LibMAD has been a bit of a thorn in our side for some years, and as it is also GPL, it does not really fit with our closed source phase, so we have spent the past 3 months working on a resolution. We have two drivers, Libmpeg123, and dr_mp3. Libmpeg123 will be added when we are open source, and currently is on a closed branch not for distribution. dr_mp3 is the new library we have chosen to fully support as it finally adds VBR support, it\u0026rsquo;s lightweight, and also finally stops one of the broken_pipe problems on the Raspberry Pi 2/3 boards. It also has meant we have taken the time to identify more problems with the sound delivery in the game, so we will be fixing these in the future. For now we have tweaked the pipe to be consistent across drivers, so this also has given us a better experience across the different modes. We also will be looking at a new asynchronous loading mode for Keysounds, primarily for beat/popn so the load times will be reduced and this will deliver a better player experience.\nIf you experience any issues with the new sound driver, do let us know, but it has had some serious testing so we\u0026rsquo;re hoping it is stable and sane for you guys!\nThe other fixes for this month include:\nALL:\n ❕✅🐲 Fix texture buffer inconsistencies in RageTextureManager ❕✅🐲 Fixed resolution of some broken actorframe calls ❕✅ Fixed several pointer dereferences in actor handling ❕✅ Fixed a few missing casts in the GL pipe ❕✅ Fixed missing oem102 key for foreign keyboards ❕✅ Fixed bad issues with variables in RageSurface ❕✅ Revert C++ opts until the new compile method is finished ❕✅ Fixed absf math issues when calculating locations ❕✅ Fix compiler unoptimised functions causing slowdown on tweens ❕✅ Prevent overlapped centering when - 1p occurs (Thanks Neko²) ❕✅ Fix sizing on - 6/8 panel modes ❕✅ Fix size of notefield via AR over ScreenWidth ❕✅ Allow HoldJudgements to receive Player variables ❕✅ Change round method on stats display ❕✅ Support for toggling audio preview modes for ScreenSelectMusic ❕✅🐲 Changed the use of ragefile within sound engine ❕✅🐲 Removed GL 4.6 and 3.3 due to windows 10 update bugs killing the intel driver ❕✅📝 Fixed Esc not leaving test input screen Issue #41 (Thanks Moru!) ❕✅📝 Allowed early dismissal of input keybind warning Issue 40 ❕✅📝 Fixed non-random Seed generation for game/stage Issue 38 (Thanks JustinLove) ❕✅📝 Fixed Game Crash in Extended/Course Mode Issue 29 (Thanks Jubo) ❕✅📝 Fixed FPS Slowdown on some GPUs Issue 25 (Thanks LightningSkunk) ❕✅📝 Fixed Notefield Overlaps on Center 1 player Issue 24 (Thanks SilentTempest83/Neko²) ❕✅📝 Fixed Random noteskins failing to activate Issue 21 (Thanks bibusdax) ❕✅📝 Make ScreenTextEntry handle caps lock once more Issue #13(Thanks Moru!)

Due to windows updates, (and Ubuntu updates) that have directly affected several of our users, we have taken the time to bring forward our plans to fix this sooner rather that later.\nWhat this means to you, our players. You now have a choice of using the XInput which will be enabled by default, (and has been the norm since alpha 4.5) which gives the familiar buttons on the XBox controller. We have added a new controller option row in the \u0026lsquo;Experimental Settings\u0026rsquo; which will allow easy change, you will need to reboot your game to reinitialise the input system, but we will make this a non-game reset option in a future update. There is also a preference you can edit which is called UseOldJoystickMapping setting this to 0 sets the XInput mode, and setting this to 1 enables the legacy (HIDAPI) mode for your controller or pad.\nYou will likely need to check your offset for this update, if you are swapping modes, as some controllers behave slightly different in legacy/XInput. This is true especially of custom Arduino pads, so take time to remember to test this.\nIf you use older controllers, please ensure they are plugged in BEFORE you start the game. Because we do not depend on DirectX anymore, we need to initialise the system on game start. We are looking into this, but once the system is live, controllers can be added and removed as normal. We really do not want to go back to DInput7 or DInput8 as Microsoft is really punishing use of these system and will remove them outright eventually.\nKeyboard players can use either method, this update fixed a couple of awry driver update issues on steelseries/Corsair keyboards to fix their polling issue, so you can play as normal.\nIf you have an SMX 4k/5k/pump pad, you can use either mode, but some players have mentioned that legacy \u0026lsquo;feels tighter\u0026rsquo; than XInput for this pad. Give it a try and let us know your thoughts.\nThis new mode allows for more than 4 controllers (which XInput is limited to by design), and does not require a mapping for the gamecontrollerdb.txt file which XInput pads require. This new mode allows the older Joystick path to run, which is based on HIDAPI, thus giving us a greater level of controller support than ever before. If your controller does not show up in OutFox, or has become troublesome since the operating system updates, this is the mode for you. If you have any issues with the new system (bear in mind, you WILL need to go to Key mapping and map all the buttons for your controller to their actions. YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE CONTROLLER MAPPING WITH THIS MODE!\nThe legacy mode returns to a slightly more familiar system from 5.1/5.0 so those of you with particularly troublesome controllers will no longer have issues. The ParaParaParadise Controller prefers to be on legacy. So if you use OutFox for Para/ParaStar/EKS-D remember to set this in your game, and restart. The PPP Controller needs to be plugged in BEFORE you start the game, due to how windows operates now. This is true for Ubuntu also. Mac OSX now also properly supports this controller.\nOn the subject of ParaPara Paradise, this month has seen a lot of work and collaboration to finally fix some of the glaring issues for this mode. We will continue to do this for all our modes, so look out for updates!\nParaPara Paradise mode has been given a swathe of fixes:     ❕✅ Fixed Noteskin loading on PPP mode ❕✅ Fixed missing theme elements on PPP mode ❕✅ Added new timing windows for PPP mode, which match the PS2/2nd Mix games ❕✅ Added new judgement names for PPP mode to match PS2/2nd Mix ❕✅ Added new Tick hit support - This allows for a hit if the sensor is triggered, as per the original games ❕✅ Added new Hold Tick Hit support - Fixes a long overdue bug in holds on PPP mode. ❕✅ Added new column style \u0026lsquo;active\u0026rsquo; when a sensor is triggered, to closer match the original games ❕✅ Added 2 player support for PPP mode ❕✅ Fixed PPP controller buttons not being recognised in game ❕✅ Added new default noteskin for PPP mode ❕✅ Added new Jara noteskin for PPP mode ❕✅ Fixed evaluation screen elements causing an edge case crash ❕✅ Fixed how the game records play details to be more accurate to the original play experience. ❕✅ Fixed Rate mode being set to a weird value ❕✅ Fixed Speed Mod. For accurate arcade experience, use A or C mod, between 100-300, we feel the sweet spot is 100-150 ❕✅ Fixed missing gameplay elements  We hope you all enjoy the new revamped Para Mode, and remember it\u0026rsquo;s also playable on MacOS fully for the first time! If you have any feedback or questions please do not hesitate to contact us on the discord!\nNew Loading Window     ❕✅🐲 New loading song error checking - The log will tell you about bad songs ❕✅🐲 New loading window system ❕✅🐲 Support UTF-8 on new loading window ❕✅🐲 New themeable loading window ❕✅🐲 Custom Font loading support ❕✅🐲 New font rendering  This version sees the launch of a new loading window, which has plagued the game since 2007. We plan to use this new window for more features in the future, and it will become fully themeable for those of you that wish to modify it. It is cross platform so replaces the legacy Linux Loader, and the horribly bugged MacOSX loader. The other good thing about this mode is when you load songs, it will check your audio files for availability. What this means, if the file is corrupted or damaged, or just unable to be loaded by the game, you will get a notice in your log file. For ease of viewing, you can scan the games songs with the new version, then check out info.txt in your /logs folder. if you have any damaged songs or corrupt mp3s etc, they will be logged here. An example from my own simfile collection:\nWARNING: Sound file /AdditionalSongs/parapara/Big O/Big O.ogg couldn't be opened: . Please check it is not corrupted and redownload the file.\nWe hope you find this a welcome addition, as it will prevent some sudden crashing or silence being played in the song wheel. This feature will be worked on in the future, so if you have any ideas please throw them our way! Sometimes the window will look like it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;locked up\u0026rsquo; on Windows - this is just the SSC cache being generated! Give it a moment and it\u0026rsquo;ll sort itself out, it only does it once.\nWe have plans to allow the online patcher and for configurations to be changed/set up for the future, so I\u0026rsquo;m hoping it is stable for you all and works as designed.\nNew MP3 Driver:     ❕✅ Removed libMAD and it\u0026rsquo;s dependencies ❕✅ Added new dr_mp3 MP3 Driver (clean for closed source phase) ❕✅ Added new libmpeg123 MP3 Driver (not in repo but available for open source phase) ❕✅🐲 Fixed internal Threads overflow ❕✅🐲 Fixed internal buffer sizes ❕✅🐲 Set modern system settings to allow transition  This has been in the background for some time. LibMAD has been a bit of a thorn in our side for some years, and as it is also GPL, it does not really fit with our closed source phase, so we have spent the past 3 months working on a resolution. We have two drivers, Libmpeg123, and dr_mp3. Libmpeg123 will be added when we are open source, and currently is on a closed branch not for distribution. dr_mp3 is the new library we have chosen to fully support as it finally adds VBR support, it\u0026rsquo;s lightweight, and also finally stops one of the broken_pipe problems on the Raspberry Pi 2/3 boards. It also has meant we have taken the time to identify more problems with the sound delivery in the game, so we will be fixing these in the future. For now we have tweaked the pipe to be consistent across drivers, so this also has given us a better experience across the different modes. We also will be looking at a new asynchronous loading mode for Keysounds, primarily for beat/popn so the load times will be reduced and this will deliver a better player experience.\nIf you experience any issues with the new sound driver, do let us know, but it has had some serious testing so we\u0026rsquo;re hoping it is stable and sane for you guys!\nThe other fixes for this month include:\nALL:\n ❕✅🐲 Fix texture buffer inconsistencies in RageTextureManager ❕✅🐲 Fixed resolution of some broken actorframe calls ❕✅ Fixed several pointer dereferences in actor handling ❕✅ Fixed a few missing casts in the GL pipe ❕✅ Fixed missing oem102 key for foreign keyboards ❕✅ Fixed bad issues with variables in RageSurface ❕✅ Revert C++ opts until the new compile method is finished ❕✅ Fixed absf math issues when calculating locations ❕✅ Fix compiler unoptimised functions causing slowdown on tweens ❕✅ Prevent overlapped centering when - 1p occurs (Thanks Neko²) ❕✅ Fix sizing on - 6/8 panel modes ❕✅ Fix size of notefield via AR over ScreenWidth ❕✅ Allow HoldJudgements to receive Player variables ❕✅ Change round method on stats display ❕✅ Support for toggling audio preview modes for ScreenSelectMusic ❕✅🐲 Changed the use of ragefile within sound engine ❕✅🐲 Removed GL 4.6 and 3.3 due to windows 10 update bugs killing the intel driver ❕✅📝 Fixed Esc not leaving test input screen Issue #41 (Thanks Moru!) ❕✅📝 Allowed early dismissal of input keybind warning Issue 40 ❕✅📝 Fixed non-random Seed generation for game/stage Issue 38 (Thanks JustinLove) ❕✅📝 Fixed Game Crash in Extended/Course Mode Issue 29 (Thanks Jubo) ❕✅📝 Fixed FPS Slowdown on some GPUs Issue 25 (Thanks LightningSkunk) ❕✅📝 Fixed Notefield Overlaps on Center 1 player Issue 24 (Thanks SilentTempest83/Neko²) ❕✅📝 Fixed Random noteskins failing to activate Issue 21 (Thanks bibusdax) ❕✅📝 Make ScreenTextEntry handle caps lock once more Issue #13(Thanks Moru!)

Some modifiers can be selected through the options menu before starting a song, but there are also simfiles with scripted modifiers that tend to have a wildly different experience than just a regular simfile. (Generally, they\u0026rsquo;re known as \u0026ldquo;modfiles\u0026rdquo;)\nGeneral notes    Often, modifiers (or \u0026ldquo;mods\u0026rdquo;) have what\u0026rsquo;s called an \u0026ldquo;approach rate\u0026rdquo;, which is how fast it\u0026rsquo;ll go to reach the specified value. When not specified, an approach rate of 1 is used, which means 100% per second.\nSo, if you have a modifier that goes from 0 to 200%, it will take 2 seconds, while 200% to -150% would take 3.5 seconds. The approach rate can be a floating point number, so values like 0.24523 or 3.7 are valid.\nApproach rates cannot be negative in OutFox alpha 4.8.2 or earlier, or it will crash.\nIn \u0026ldquo;NotITG\u0026rdquo; \u0026amp; OutFox alpha 4.8.3 and later, negative approach rates (specifically -1 in NotITG, but in general on SM5) are used to signify \u0026ldquo;instant\u0026rdquo; rates. in older versions of SM5, you can use large approach rate numbers (such as 10000 or 9e9) to achieve this.\nMagnitude is usually shown in the form of percentages for modifiers, and are capable of being negative, unless otherwise noted.\nThere are also column-specific modifiers. This affect a single column instead of the whole notefield. In NotITG, column numbering starts at 0, while it starts at 1 in SM5.\nFor the column-specific lua functions (except for gradients, mentioned later), nil can be given as the column to affect all columns of a player. (Does not work in alpha 4.8.2 of OutFox or earlier)\nModstrings    Normally these modifiers will have a modstring form that follows this general format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;percentage\u0026gt;% \u0026lt;mod name\u0026gt; but some modifiers, like speed mods, may not follow that format.\nWhen not given a percentage, 100% is assumed. no is another way to say 0% as well.\neg: *2 bumpy is the same as *2 100% bumpy.\nThe % is optional and modstrings can work without it, but it\u0026rsquo;s there for visual convenience.\neg: *2 200 bumpy is the same as *2 200% bumpy.\nThe mod name is case insensitive.\nThese modstrings can be used either by simfile ATTACKS, course MODS, or through PlayerOptions' FromString function. Smaller numbers like 0.5 require the preceding 0.\nAny modifier or sub modifier that is boolean has a turning point of 50%. Giving 50% or more will turn it on, while 49% or lower will turn it off.\nPlayerOptions Functions    Going from modstrings to PlayerOptions functions, the magnitude has to be divided by 100 most of the time, and mod names are now case sensitive.\nWhen calling a PlayerOptions function, they often have an optional final boolean parameter that can be placed after all of the parameters that allows for function chaining similar to what Actor does, allowing for something like this:\nXMod(2.5, 3, true):Drunk(-0.75, 2.7)\nWhen passed nothing in the parameters, the function returns two values: the current magnitude, the current approach rate. However, when passed in parameters, the previous values for magnitude and rate are returned.\nYou can grab a player\u0026rsquo;s PlayerOptions for scripting purposes by doing the following:\nlocal po = {GAMESTATE:GetPlayerState(\u0026#39;PlayerNumber_P1\u0026#39;):GetPlayerOptions(\u0026#39;ModsLevel_Song\u0026#39;),GAMESTATE:GetPlayerState(\u0026#39;PlayerNumber_P2\u0026#39;):GetPlayerOptions(\u0026#39;ModsLevel_Song\u0026#39;)} This stores them into a table for easy access at any point during the song. po[1] is what you\u0026rsquo;d use to affect Player 1, while po[2] affects Player 2. Both will need to be used to affect both players with the same mods.\nSimfile ATTACKS and course MODS will override \u0026amp; reset anything set through lua on the Song level, and cannot be player-specific.\nVideo Examples    The video examples for the modifiers use an excerpt of GPOP\u0026rsquo;s expert chart for \u0026ldquo;My Story\u0026rdquo; from the \u0026ldquo;G.P.O.P.S. 3\u0026rdquo; pack.\nThe speed mod used is 1.5x, and the noteskin usually is the default noteskin for dance mode, with Exact3D used when needed.\nThe magnitude used in the video examples also may not be the value used in the textual example.\n"},{"id":24,"href":"/releases/A4.5.9/","title":"OutFox Alpha 4.5.9 Build","parent":"Release History","content":"Release Date: 14th June 2020    All platforms     Fix OpenGL context math overflow edge crash Fix math overflow in arroweffects Added math speedups in notedisplay Fix wayward frame counting on pump and para Added new math functions for 2 dimensional actors 🐲 Removed RageVector2 from the game 🐲 Added new catch all to move users on \u0026lt;= GL 2.0 to the OpenGL Renderer 🐲 Fixed Texture Size overflow Fixed Sprite Overflow causing edge crash (Thanks HeySora!)

These modifiers are not column-specific, unlike later mods described elsewhere.\nNegative speed modifiers cannot be selected from the Player Options menu, nor can it be set through the lua functions PlayerOptions provides, but it can become negative through the use of mod strings (and some modfiles have taken advantage of that).\nXMod    Desc: The \u0026ldquo;X\u0026rdquo; in \u0026ldquo;XMod\u0026rdquo; is for multiply, with it often showing as 1x or 2.5x or some other multiplier value followed by an x. Larger multiplier numbers result in a faster scroll. This speed mod type is capable of showing BPM changes, stops and other chart segment types.

Larger BPM values result in faster scroll speeds. This speed mod type visibly ignores chart segments and only shows a constant speed. (some forks of SM even disqualify if the chart has BPM changes and CMod is used!) Other modifiers still work on CMod, though.\nOften ranges of 200 to 400 (and in between at practically any specified granularity) can be common, but some people may be more comfortable reading at slower or faster speeds.\nQuirks: When setting this through the lua function it will immediately override XMod, MMod or AMod unlike how it functions in courses or modstring-based modfiles.\nPlayerOptions format: CMod(\u0026lt;BPM Value\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: CMod(200, 0.5)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; c\u0026lt;BPM value\u0026gt;\nExample: *0.5 c200\nMMod    Desc: The \u0026ldquo;M\u0026rdquo; in \u0026ldquo;MMod\u0026rdquo; is for \u0026ldquo;Maximum BPM Scroll\u0026rdquo;, with it often showing as m200 or m450.5 or some other BPM value preceded by an m. Unlike CMod, this speed modifier supports everything that XMod does. Instead of specifying a BPM speed for the whole song, this specifies the maximum scroll speed that will be used.\nOften ranges of 200 to 400 (and in between at practically any specified granularity) can be common, but some people may be more comfortable reading at slower or faster speeds.\nQuirks: The magnitude is in the hundreds most of the time, so a larger approach rate might be needed.\nPlayerOptions format: MMod(\u0026lt;BPM Value\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: MMod(200, 0.5)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; m\u0026lt;BPM value\u0026gt;\nExample: *0.5 m200\nAMod    Desc: The \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; in \u0026ldquo;AMod\u0026rdquo; is for \u0026ldquo;Average BPM Scroll\u0026rdquo;, with it often showing as a200 or a450.5 or some other BPM value preceded by an a. Like MMod, this modifier supports everything XMod supports, and the song\u0026rsquo;s BPM is used in calculations, the average of the song\u0026rsquo;s BPMs is calculated instead of the maximum BPM being used. (and the amount of time a BPM lasts for is taken into account, too)\nOften ranges of 200 to 400 (and in between at practically any specified granularity) can be common, but some people may be more comfortable reading at slower or faster speeds.\nQuirks: The magnitude is in the hundreds most of the time, so a larger approach rate might be needed.\nPlayerOptions format: AMod(\u0026lt;BPM Value\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: AMod(200, 0.5)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; a\u0026lt;BPM value\u0026gt;\nExample: *0.5 a200\nRandomSpeed    Desc: Each note is given a random addition to its' speed mod, with larger additions being applied when a higher magnitude is used. This does not have column-specific controls.\nNormally, 100 is the magnitude used (as it\u0026rsquo;s not commonly used in modfiles), but other values are valid.\nQuirks: Only values greater than zero have any visual effect.

Unlike the speed modifiers listed above, there is no modstring form for any of these.\nTimeSpacing    Desc: Allows one to switch between CMod and the remaining mods. At 100%, this tells the game to use CMods. 0% means use XMod/MMod/AMod.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s tweenable like other modifiers, which allows one to tween \u0026lsquo;between\u0026rsquo; CMods and the other mods.\nOften the values used only range between 0 and 100%\nQuirks: The \u0026lsquo;tweening\u0026rsquo; capability can cause interesting stutter effects while tweening. Some modfiles take advantage of this. This cannot be replicated with the plain CMod \u0026amp; XMod PlayerOptions functions, but can be replicated with modstrings.\nPlayerOptions format: TimeSpacing(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: TimeSpacing(1)\nScrollBPM (Used for CMod, values are BPMs)    Desc: This is the underlying BPM value that CMod uses.

This is often used to change from upscroll to downscroll among other effects.\nReverse    Desc: Reverse flips the scroll of the whole notefield from upscroll to downscroll. There is also a column-specific version that adds onto the value of normal Reverse.\nCommonly, 50% or 100% is used on its' own.\nQuirks: When going over 100%, the effect goes backwards, with 200% being normal upscroll again. Negative values go upward resulting in a longer notefield. This applies to the column-specific version, too. Going to 100% on column 1 will also make the judgment \u0026amp; combo swap positions.\nFor example, 100% reverse + 100% reverse on a single column would result in that single column having upscroll and the rest being downscroll.\nAvailable Variants (modstring): reverse, reverse\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;\nPlayerOptions format: Reverse(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: Reverse(1, 2)\nColumn-specific format: ReverseCol(\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: ReverseCol(2, 0.25, 0.25)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modstring variant\u0026gt;\nexample: *2 100% reverse *0.25 25% reverse2\nReverse video example\nAvailable sub modifiers:    UnboundedReverse    Desc: UnboundedReverse is a boolean modifier that makes it so Reverse no longer bounces back when going over 100% (Acts similar to negative reverse, behavior-wise). This affects all reverse-type modifiers, including Split, Alternate and Cross. In NotITG, this is known as reversetype.\nPlayerOptions format: UnboundedReverse(\u0026lt;enable\u0026gt;)\nmodstring format: \u0026lt;enable\u0026gt; unboundedreverse\nSplit    Desc: The second half of the notefield gets reversed.\nCommonly, 50% or 100% is used on its' own.\nQuirks: Same as Reverse. If used in modes with an odd number of columns, the middle column also gets affected.\nPlayerOptions format: Split(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: Split(0.75,3)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; split\nexample: *3 75% reverse\nSplit video example\nAlternate    Desc: Every other column gets reversed, starting with the second column. Also can be activated with ultraman in NotITG.\nCommonly, 50% or 100% is used on its' own.\nQuirks: Same as Reverse.\nPlayerOptions format: Alternate(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: Alternate(1, 1)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; alternate\nexample: *1 100% alternate\nAlternate video example\nCross    Desc: The inner part of the notefield gets reversed with the outer sides staying as upscroll.\nCommonly, 50% or 100% is used on its' own.\nQuirks: Same as Reverse.\nPlayerOptions format: Cross(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: Cross(0.25, 4)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; cross\nexample: *4 25% cross\nCross video example\nCentered    Desc: Centered moves the notefield down to where the receptors are at the center of the whole field at 100% (which is usually around the middle of the screen), taking the above scroll modifiers into account (As seen with Alternate in the video example). Commonly used to create \u0026ldquo;driven drops\u0026rdquo;. Can also be activated with converge in modstring form.\nAlso often combined with other scroll modifiers above.\nCommonly used at 100%, but more or less can be used. Negative values move the notefield up.\nQuirks: The speed it has when going to the center depends on multiple theme metrics, so \u0026ldquo;driven drop\u0026rdquo; effects may be inconsistent across multiple themes. Most modfiles expect ITG positioning, which is available as the \u0026ldquo;Lower\u0026rdquo; note position setting in the default theme. The player\u0026rsquo;s Combo also moves down based on the current amount of Centered.\nPlayerOptions format: Centered(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: Centered(1. 0.5)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; centered\nexample: *0.5 100% centered\nCentered video example\nCenteredPath    Desc: While Centered moves the notefield down in position, CenteredPath moves the columns down their current path in multiples of the column\u0026rsquo;s width (Commonly 64 pixels for dance mode). This consist amount allows for more consistent \u0026ldquo;driven drops\u0026rdquo; across different setups. In NotITG, this modifier is called centered2.\nLarge amounts of CenteredPath may be used because \u0026ldquo;driven drops\u0026rdquo; can span the whole screen height.\nWhen combined with the opposite amount of MoveY in upscroll, interesting movement effects can be achieved.\nQuirks: Because CenteredPath moves columns down the path, receptors may become affected by mods that otherwise would not affect them (As seen in the video example with Tornado), and note paths may look different.\nPlayerOptions format: CenteredPath(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: CenteredPath(2.5,0.23)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; centeredpath\nexample: *0.23 250% centeredpath\nCenteredPath video example\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;Driven Drop\u0026rdquo;?    Driven Drops are an effect where the notes are stationary while the receptor moves down to hit the notes. (As seen in the ITG course, \u0026ldquo;Driven\u0026rdquo;)\nOften, speed mod has to be taken into account for these (which can be made simpler by forcing a speed mod).\nCenteredPath makes it easier due to using a consistent amount that doesn\u0026rsquo;t depend on multiple theme metrics, but the resulting effect may look different.\n\u0026ldquo;SCAR\u0026rdquo; Gimmicks    Before column-specific Reverse existed, Combinations of Split, Cross, Alternate and Reverse (SCAR, for short) were used to generate column-specific reverse in 4 panel modes.

This roadmap was what we targeted during our alpha 3 stage, commonly known as \u0026lsquo;bronze\u0026rsquo; internally. We had a branch running alongside which was known as \u0026lsquo;silver\u0026rsquo; as it had been tried and tested code from a lot of work done before.\nDue to how little time we had and after the branch merge fail which lost us around 5 months work on this fork, \u0026lsquo;silver\u0026rsquo; was abandoned and restarted as alpha 4. We did not have a properly defined direction during this part of the project, it was more about fixing massive glaring bugs to make the game smoother to build upon, as the base game did not like being changed at all. The other main part of the project at this point was to get MacOSX compiling and moving in the right direction. The game didn\u0026rsquo;t work at all, nor did it even run correctly when we got it working. That ate most of 2019\u0026rsquo;s development time. This was worth it in the long run, as it has made it a lot easier to support newer versions of the OS, as well as the new M1 architecture from Apple.\n ✅ Update GLEW ✅ Update and fix MacOSX building and compiling ✅ Fix Windows 7 compiling and crashing ✅ Fix libraries ✅ Change math system ✅ Fix ALSA referencing so the driver works ✅ Fix InputDevice referencing in Linux ✅ Fix clock methodology on MacOSX ✅ Move internal systems to support SDL ✅ LLW fixes on Linux and MacOSX ✅ Rewrite most of darwin code to support Catalina Beta ✅ Move codebase to C++11   Completion Date: 30th December 2019     "},{"id":47,"href":"/releases/A4.0/","title":"OutFox Alpha 4.0 Build","parent":"Release History","content":"Release Date: 16th December 2019     Fix up NoteField zoom and positioning math for soundwaves.

Its main goals include:\n Refactoring its internal codebase to improve performance, adhere to modern coding practices, and enhance its capabilities on modern hardware and other platforms. We have worked on support for single-board ARM systems such as Raspberry Pi), and improvements to uncapped frame rate have also been recorded on hardware as far back as the Pentium E2180. Improving its support for other gameplay styles beyond dance games; we are treating the project as a cross-platform \u0026ldquo;sandbox\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;museum\u0026rdquo; for rhythm games, rather than simply a simulator/emulator for popular dance game franchises.  As Project OutFox is a continuation of the 5.0.12 and 5.1 codebase (not “5.2”), it remains compatible with almost all existing songs, themes, and noteskins that are supported on these versions (if you do encounter odd behaviour or other issues with older content, please report it to us as a bug).

OutFox inherits this behaviour. Everything in the engine is an Actor at its' very core.\nBecause everything is an actor, there are many types of actors, which are described below. Not everything listed is able to be created in Lua. Those that aren\u0026rsquo;t will be noted as such. However, all of these can be found in the Lua environment.\nA note on LoadActor()    This is a helper function that can be used to dynamically load an actor based on the file type. However, this should not be used as it is more resource intensive and can be easily avoided when the filetype is known. For loading external lua files, loadfile(path)() can be used, though the full path is required.\n   A note on LoadActor() ActorFrame  Inline building Concatenation   ActorFrameTexture ActorMultiTexture ActorProxy ActorScroller Banner BGAnimation BitmapText BPMDisplay ComboGraph ControllerStateDisplay CourseContentsList DeviceList DifficultyIcon DynamicActorScroller FadingBanner GradeDisplay GraphDisplay GrooveRadar HelpDisplay HoldJudgment InputList LogDisplay LifeMeter LifeMeterBattery MemoryCardDisplay MenuTimer MeterDisplay Model ModIconRow MusicWheel NoteColumnRenderer NoteField OptionRow PaneDisplay PercentageDisplay Player Quad RollingNumbers ScoreDisplayAliveTime ScoreDisplayCalories Screen SongBPMDisplay SongMeterDisplay Sound StepsDisplay StepsDisplayList TextBanner WheelBase WheelItemBase WorkoutGraph     --  ActorMultiVertex   Sprite   BitmapText      ActorFrame    An Actor that can contain one or more Actors. Think of it as a box that can hold as many objects as it can.\nExample:\nDef.ActorFrame{ -- This sprite is now included inside of the ActorFrame. -- Any changes from the ActorFrame will affect the sprite, such as position, rotation, -- zoom and such. Def.Sprite{} } ActorFrames can hold other actors. The Def. format is set up like any other lua table, allowing for creating actors in batches. Because of this, there are multiple ways to build an ActorFrame.\nInline building    Actors can be explicitly placed into an ActorFrame like this:\nDef.ActorFrame{ Def.Actor{ --Commands and stuff go here. }, Def.Sprite{ --More commands and stuff go here. } } Concatenation    Because lua tables can be concatenated (added) to each other, so can ActorFrames.\nThis can allow for programatically creating Actors in batches as needed.\nHowever, if one does not plan on creating actors programmaticly, then a simple return Def.ActorFrame{... is all that\u0026rsquo;s needed. Storing it into a local variable that gets returned will waste resources.\nThere are two ways to add onto an actorframe.\nMethod 1 (indexing):\nlocal t = Def.ActorFrame{ Def.Sprite{ --commands \u0026amp; stuff }, Def.BitmapText{ --who even knows }, } t[#t+1] = Def.Actor{ --It\u0026#39;s the third actor } return t Method 2 (lua concatenation):\nreturn Def.ActorFrame{ Def.Sprite{ --commands \u0026amp; stuff }, Def.BitmapText{ --who even knows }, } .. Def.Actor{ --It\u0026#39;s the third actor } ActorFrameTexture    It\u0026rsquo;s like an ActorFrame, but instead of displaying what\u0026rsquo;s inside onto the screen, it places the contents of the ActorFrame onto a Texture that a Sprite (or any other actor that can load textures) can read from.\nPopularized by its' use in NotITG, although the behavior is different. NotITG\u0026rsquo;s version places the screen itself onto a texture instead of what\u0026rsquo;s inside the ActorFrame and requires basezoom to be used on sprites to make the image fit inside the game window.\nExample:\n--[[ This example will create an ActorFrameTexture that uses a sample BitmapText, and project it to the center to the screen in half of the available size of the viewport window. ]] -- This ActorFrame will contain everything. local t = Def.ActorFrame{} -- First, create the ActorFrameTexture. local AFT = Def.ActorFrameTexture{ InitCommand = function(self) -- Start by adding a name to the texture.

To stop that, use the loop command to -- set the flag to false. self:loop(false) end } Meshes are the composition and structure of the Model. This data represents the vertices that make the Model take shape.\nMaterials are the textures that the model will use. These can be any of the image formats listed in the Supported File Extensions page. They can also be .ini files that define animated textures on a Def.Sprite.\nBones make the model come to life. They can be defined within the primary model file, or, in the case of dancing characters, be controlled via a separate file that only contains the bones.\nIn the above example, all three attributes used the same filepath; all the necessary data was contained within a single file. It is possible to configure the MilkShape 3D software to output distinct files for meshes, materials, and bones, and set each Def.Model attribute accordingly, but that is outside the scope of this lesson.\nNOTE: All three attributes must be provided within Def.Model as paths to resources that can be loaded or the game will crash.\nWith OutFox, you can store several types of animations on the same model and call them at any moment.\n-- Let\u0026#39;s load a animation called WarmUp, located on a file called \u0026#34;Warm1.txt\u0026#34;. self:LoadBones( \u0026#34;WarmUp\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Warm1.txt\u0026#34; ) -- Now the model has an animation called \u0026#34;WarmUp\u0026#34;, and can be called at any time with playanimation. -- The second value is optional, and sets the rate of the animation\u0026#39;s speed. self:playanimation( \u0026#34;WarmUp\u0026#34;, 1 ) ModIconRow    Shows icons for the currently set modifiers of a player.\nNot all modifiers have an icon, and the settings can only be set through metrics.\nMusicWheel    Cannot be created from lua, but can be grabbed from the TopScreen.\nThe wheel used to select songs in ScreenSelectMusic or courses in ScreenSelectCourse.\nNoteColumnRenderer    Cannot be created from lua, but can be grabbed from NoteField.\nThis is a dedicated actor for a column in the notefield, and can be treated like any other actor.\nNoteField    Cannot be created from lua, but resides in Player.\nContains the receptors and notes as seen in gameplay.\nOptionRow    Cannot be created from lua.\nOften seen in options screens, this actor allows for picking and choosing various options for a given setting.\nPaneDisplay    Shows the number of steps, jumps, holds, rolls, mines, hands, lifts, fakes, the machine profile\u0026rsquo;s highscore \u0026amp; name and the current profile\u0026rsquo;s high score for a given chart.\nSettings must be defined through Metrics.\nPercentageDisplay    Shows a player\u0026rsquo;s current percentage (Actual DancePoints divided by Possible DancePoints).\nPlayer    Cannot be created from lua, but is part of ScreenGameplay\nThe entirety of the playfield.

There are screens for gameplay, selecting music, pre-gameplay, etc. Each screen has a background, underlay, overlay and decorations that can be used.\nSongBPMDisplay    Shows the current BPM during gameplay. Does not appear to take split timing into account.\nSongMeterDisplay    A MeterDisplay that shows the current position of the song being played.\nDef.SongMeterDisplay{ InitCommand=function(self) -- This generates a 300 x [the height of your Stream texture] that will define the current progress of whatever song is currently being played. -- The actor will automatically update progress for the Tip and the Stream. self:SetStreamWidth( 300 ) end, -- Both the Stream and Tip are AutoActors, so they can be any actor type.

The following page contains details on the BMS/PMS channels that Project OutFox currently supports. This is a living document, and will be updated as progress is made to expand the work to support as much of these as possible.\n Introduction     The BMS file standard was devised by Urao Yane in 1998. It was originally created to be a format to simulate the game Beatmania by Konami. There have been several dozen interations over the years, and we will talk about some of them here in one easy to contain and read page. Do not be afraid of this format, it is incredibly versatile and have been used to simulate a variety of games.\nProject OutFox uses mostly BM98 (1998 to 2003) era definitions for this file standard, though it is improving all the time. The format is used to simulate most of the \u0026lsquo;Down Scroll Rhythm Game Systems\u0026rsquo; and is known by several other derivatives which we are also slowly building support for.\nBMS charts are mostly composed by artists from Asia, so reading them in non-asian locales can be difficult. OutFox will be overcoming this limitation in a future update, so do not delete all your charts which just show ?????????? just yet!\nThe other two file types on this page, PMS and BME were born from this format and are used for other types of games. PMS was originally designed to simulate Keyboardmania and had a very different channel layout than BMS, but it\u0026rsquo;s use moved towards po-mu / feeling po-mu (po-mu is short for Pop\u0026rsquo;n Music). This had a unique layout for 9 key/button charts.\nBME is an Extension of BMS and offers newer features that were not offered in raw simulators of BM98. This was also used in the actual arcade and console games for a few years in the early 2000s. Project OutFox recently fixed a lot of support for this parser, along with adding several of the missing modes often charted by simfile authors. This extension allowed for channel numbers beyond 00-99 (99 values), then extended to base16 for 00-FF (255 values), which was then finally extended to 00-ZZ (1295 values), being based on base36.\nThe other system we support is BML files, which PMS incorporated by default in 2002. BML adds Long Note (known as holds in StepMania), which again extends the BMS specification. We will support both BME and BML fully in an upcoming release and update these documents in the future.\nAgain, if you feel any particular command or object should be included, do let us know. There are quite a few bits of the specification that just simply have not been considered or added at this time, I\u0026rsquo;m documenting what we do have, and you are more than welcome to give suggestions for future additions. - Squirrel\n Basic Format     The BMS file format describes how notes are arranged and how the game is meant to behave if/when a player takes a specific action. It is usually a simple plain text file with the command lines starting with the # character.\nThe file consists of a HEADER FIELD section and a MAIN DATA FIELD section. We will be going through in detail on the most commonly used commands and channels so you have the information here. A lot of the available commands ever offered to BMS/PMS over the years have faded into deprecation/not being used, but the ones we have seen in actual files include what we will be supporting.\nIf you find a file that is not showing up in OutFox you may need to switch the encoding options of the chart, or just wait until the new string system is added in the future.\nCommands are in the header formatted as the following:    #[Command] [Value]\nFor these commands, a space between the command and value is required or you will have offset issues in most simulators. A Simple Example of some common commands used in the header field are:\n*---------------------- HEADER FIELD #PLAYER 3 #GENRE Dance #TITLE My Dance Classics #ARTIST DJ Superstar #BPM 128 #PLAYLEVEL 5 #TOTAL 100 #RANK 2 #bmp00 miss.bmp #bmp01 01.bmp #wav01 01.wav *---------------------- MAIN DATA FIELD #00111:01010101 #00211:0101010001010100  Common HEADER FIELD commands     #PLAYER n [1 - 4]    Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#PLAYER 3 This command defines the play style that the chart is set for. In the earlier versions of BMS they also specified the number of players.\n  1 = 1 Player or Single Play, with 1 life gauge.     2 = 1 + 2 Player or Couples Play, with 2 life gauges. Mostly deprecated and not used. OutFox mostly supports these and can parse them under the old iidx-* styles from SM3.x     3 = 1 Player on 2 sides, or Double play. Modern sims use this value the most, or just ignore the PLAYER setting completely. Often a lot of PMS files have value of 3, though I have not been able to find out why. OutFox supports the odd use of this command but again most simulators post 2015 ignore this value.     4 = 1 vs 2 Player, or Battle Play, with two life gauges, which was removed in iidx19, has fallen out of favour in use. I have actually only found PMS battle mode files with 3 key vs 3 key chart styles from portable 2. OutFox currently can parse these files, but has no battle mode support.   Project OutFox also supports \u0026lsquo;duet\u0026rsquo; or normal 2 player mode without needing to be set in the file itself, by joining a second player on the select music screen. As of Alpha 4.9.8 this was extended to PMS offering new modes with a 2 player option of po-mu for the first time. All popn styles (3k, 4k, 5k, 7k, 9k) have 2 player support now, with battle mode planned in the future.\n #GENRE genre [string]    Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#GENRE Blues This command sets the genre or type of music that the chart is going to play. It could be used by the simulator for sorting or grouping charts, or to allow for just more information to be displayed on the song select screen. The genre is usually written in SHIFT-JIS on older charts, but UTF8/UTF16 are becoming a lot more common, so do check.\n #TITLE title [string]    Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#TITLE Take (Bamboo) The title command sets the SongTitle and this will be displayed on the song wheel to be selected, as well on the screen gameplay and evaluation screen. It will also be recorded in high scores and on your profile etc. Older charts used SHIFT-JIS.\n #ARTIST artist [string]    Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#ARTIST 立秋 feat.ちょこ The artist command sets the SongArtist and this is usually displayed on the song wheel when selected and on the evaluation screen. The artist information is usually recorded in high scores and on your profile. Older charts used SHIFT-JIS.\n #BPM n [0.0-1400.00]/[0-255]    Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#BPM 140.35 This setting allows the chart to specify the beginning (or starting) BPM of a song. This value will also be shown in the music wheel, and will be setting the speed that will be used as part of the modifiers / scrolling of the notes. This value used to require a whole number. Project OutFox allows for floats here - you are limited to 6 decimal places - so 143.000290 as an example.\nOlder simulators do not support decimal point BPM values, and you cannot enter a value above 255 as it can crash the simulator in question. If you are wishing to make your chart portable to other programs, bear this in mind; not every simulator supports this!\nThis value also can (and will!) be overwritten by channel commands/settings later on in the chart.\n #PLAYLEVEL n [0-6]/[0-9]/[1-49]    Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#PLAYLEVEL 5 The playlevel sets the number of \u0026lsquo;stars\u0026rsquo; (from the old games) or the difficulty specified. In BMS files this difficulty ranges normally from 0 to 6 - 6 being the hardest. The older scale from 0 to 9 was from the BM98 spec, which was never really used much or supported.\nIn some BME and most PMS files, the playlevel can be from 1 to 49. This reflects the style from other games with the wider difficulty ranges, and po-mu has had a wider difficulty rating for some years.\nIn older versions of StepMania, this difficulty used to be squished into a 5 tier difficulty system and sometimes didn\u0026rsquo;t really work that well. It needed to use a hint from the file name to ensure it didn\u0026rsquo;t make everything an EDIT. This also meant that a lot of charts disappeared/were not parsed correctly and was generally not that suitable for use. OutFox has remedied this by fixing how the parser sees difficulties, and also widens the difficulty arc to out of 10 fields.\n #RANK n [0-4]    Status: ❌ Unsupported\nUsage Example:\n#RANK 2 The rank entry used in the old BMS specification used to allow the chart artist to select a difficulty on how the \u0026lsquo;timing window\u0026rsquo; would be set when playing the chart. It was designed for those simulators that didn\u0026rsquo;t have ways of difficulty or setting different timing windows.\nThere were 5 different ranks, the last being added by nanasi which was a more relaxed timing window compared to the other simulators. Almost all of the simulators that are active today set 2 as the default. The old ranking timing windows are listed below for historical purposes. They are ignored on OutFox as we have a custom timing window solution, but if you would like us to add this to set a timing system in the future, do let us know!\n   Value Label COOL Time window     0 VERY HARD +/- 8ms   1 HARD +/- 15ms   2 NORMAL +/- 18ms   3 EASY +/- 21ms   4 VERY EASY +/- 33ms    Most of these timing windows are not really tied to any specific game or methodology of timing, so it is why we made the decision to not support any of the RANK commands: we also do not support the timing system used by Angolmois which uses 6 ranks. We do not support #DEFEXRANK / #EXRANK as they were additions by nanasi and it seems they did not carry over to be commonly used in other simulators. Changing timing mid song is something we could support, but we do not really see a need to add that to the engine at this time.\nThe \u0026lsquo;timing\u0026rsquo; windows used in Project OutFox are closer to RANK 2 to follow the standard others use.\n #TOTAL n [0-999]    Status: ❌ Unsupported\nUsage Example:\n#TOTAL 430 The TOTAL command is to set the value of what could be considered an extension of the \u0026lsquo;gauge\u0026rsquo; in older simulators, before life gauges existed. The value of TOTAL is added to a normal gauge to increase it\u0026rsquo;s length. if the value was 300, then the gauge would go from 0 to 100% in size, to the intial value (normally around 25% + 300% for a total gauge size of 325%).\nThis only occurs when the notes are hit and combo is kept, otherwise things would return to the old gauge size. It was more of a consideration on gauge/groove/clear amounts (what you needed to reach to be considered a pass in that song). This did lead to some confusion on how TOTAL should affect the gameplay/level of the chart.\nThe gauge never changed size; it was an off screen calculation on how you could \u0026lsquo;score\u0026rsquo; your chart. Several simulators over the years have changed this value if TOTAL was omitted, we at the moment do not honour the value, mainly because we do not follow the iidx scoring system since 2005.\n #MAKER maker [string] or    #CREDIT credit [string] or    #SUBARTIST subartist [string]    Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#MAKER Ima StepChart or\n#CREDIT Ima StepChart or\n#SUBARTIST Ima StepChart The MAKER or CREDIT command simply allows the author or maker of the chart to add their credit so it will be displayed in the simulator. The main support for MAKER comes from around 2002 onwards. It is common in most 5 Key styles to be used, as well as being used on 10 Key (double play) styles. CREDIT is more recent, being seen from around 2013 in charts. I know not it\u0026rsquo;s origin, we support both as to not ignore honouring those that take the time to make charts for us to enjoy.\nSince around 2017, another command, SUBARTIST began to be used more commonly in BME/PMS files, which was inherited from DTX. The sub artist is not normally displayed until the evaluation screen on earlier simulators, but in OutFox we treat all three of these in the same manner. If you are creating a new BMS chart, then #MAKER is usually safer to use for other simulator support.\n #STAGEFILE stagefile [string]    Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\n#STAGEFILE loadingscreen.png The stagefile command is used to set an image to the \u0026lsquo;loading screen\u0026rsquo; of the simulator - when the song and options/modifiers have been set, this file is then placed as part of the loading process on the \u0026lsquo;loading screen\u0026rsquo;.\nOn older simulators, this loading process could take a long time, so it was wise to incorporate a loading screen system into the simulator. This has also been recently done in Project OutFox so we do not need to freeze the game while loading these files any more. This file is read in and parsed, just no theme at the moment takes advantage of the loading screen as of yet.\n Main DATA FIELD commands     #SCROLLxx n.n [-999.0 - 999.0]    Status: ✅ Supported\nDefinition Usage Example:\n#SCROLL01 0.5 #SCROLL02 1.0 #SCROLL03 -2.75 Channel Usage Example:\n#003SC:02010001 #005SC:03000002 The scroll command works similar to how it does in native SM5, but if you are unfamiliar with the system, the value is a multiplier of the speed of the movement of any note on the screen.\nIf your notes were moving at 130BPM, but you did not wish to edit the BPM directly, you could use scroll to change that speed. The game also supports negative values (this has the affect of moving things in the opposite direction), which can provide some very interesting affects.\nThe channel command to action #SCROLL values are a Base36 value which are #xxxSC. There are several benefits to using this system as legacy BMS use items you need to name on each measure, whereas #xxxSC can last beyond this restriction. You need to be aware, not many clients support this system, so it is not backwards compatible if you are making your chart available to other simulators.\n Key:     ✅ Fully supported and used in Mode ✓ Fully supported and not used in Mode 📝?

Rather than using one of the 30 spare channels in the lower ranges, these two options require full base 36 (00-ZZ) support to work as they use SC/SP instead of a Hex (00-FF) value. OutFox\u0026rsquo;s BMS-like parsers were updated in 4.9.9 to support base 36 channel values even though not required by specification, so these channels were a trivial addition to our support.\nSpeed and Scroll segments replicate behaviour done with Channel 02/08/09, without relying on these channels changing. They were introduced in the SSC updates to StepMania and are natively supported in the engine in OutFox.

Use uname -a in a terminal to find out what to download.\nFor example, the above output says x86_64, so the amd64 download would be used. (amd64 legacy would be used on older systems/linux distributions)\nRaspberry Pi users would use arm64v8 if uname shows \u0026ldquo;aarch64\u0026rdquo;, while arm32v7 would be used if uname has \u0026ldquo;armv7\u0026rdquo; in it.\nInstalling the game    Project OutFox is currently distributed as .tar.gz files for linux distributions. Through a GUI  Most distributions have a right click item in their file manager for extracting archives.\nIf the menu doesn\u0026rsquo;t have an option to extract the archive, open the file in your archive manager and extract it to somewhere convenient.

In most cases, this will be in your home directory and be something like .stepmania-5.3:\ncd /home/pi/.stepmania-5.3\nOpen up \u0026ldquo;Preferences.ini\u0026rdquo;:\nnano Preferences.ini\nScroll down to find a line that starts with LightsDriver= and change it to:\nLightsDriver=SextetStreamToFile\nPress crtl+o and hit return, then press ctrl+x to save the file and exit nano. We need to now make sure that something is going to use that file, otherwise you\u0026rsquo;ll find your system will eventually crash as that file fills up without getting emptied.\nMake sure that socat is installed on your pi:\nsudo apt install socat\nNext open up cron to have socat start at reboot by typing:\ncrontab -e\nAt the end of that window, add this line (replacing the path with the path to you FIFO file):\n@reboot socat \u0026quot;/home/pi/Desktop/OutFox/Data/StepMania-Lights-SextetStream.out\u0026quot; /dev/ttyUSB0,raw,echo=0,b155200 \u0026amp;\nPress crtl+o, return, ctrl+x to save and exit crontab. Notice the \u0026amp; at the end of the line. That\u0026rsquo;s important to let it run in the background. Otherwise your system will just sit there waiting for it to quit\u0026hellip;\nNext, create a launcher file that will run on startup. In order to do this, it should reside in the autostart folder of xdg. Easy way to do this is:\nnano /etc/xdg/autostart/OutFox.desktop\nWhen nano opens, put the following into the text file:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open [Desktop Entry] Type=Application Name=Project OutFox Exec=/home/pi/Desktop/OutFox/stepmania Ctrl+o, return, ctrl+x to save and exit the file. Make sure you also give it executable permission:\nchmod a+x /etc/xdg/autostart/OutFox.desktop\nNow if you reboot the pi, it should automatically load socat and OutFox for a session of great fun.\n(thanks to Random Hajile for the PiCab information)\n"},{"id":62,"href":"/user-guide/setup/install-mac/","title":"Installation on Mac OS","parent":"Setup","content":"Note to users using \u0026ldquo;App Store Only Applications\u0026rdquo;    Using this permission will make Gatekeeper revoke necessary permissions that Project OutFox needs to read the game content (Given the app loads files externally).

The following page contains details on the .osu parsing options that Project OutFox currently supports. This is a living document - it will be updated as time allows and we add the support or features within.\nThis documentation exists as a mental \u0026lsquo;layout\u0026rsquo; for me to learn about the format and how best to parse it for the way OutFox needs. It will be updated in a few segments - There may be errors, but do let me know so i can update and clarify them, thanks for joining me on this ride! - (Squirrel)\nWe are calling it the OTO parser as we chose to follow the Osu Tatakae Ouendan name.\nOTO Notedata support as of Alpha 4.12.0 - IN PROGRESS We have a partially working implementation of Mode 3 (Mania)!     Trivia     .osu is a format containing information about Osu beatmaps, which confusingly contain charts for other game modes as well. We use the term chart around the Scrolling Rhythm Game genre, because we do not use specific co-ordinates like on a map. The Osu Tatakae Ouendan mode uses both x and y mapping for the circles, curves and spinners etc, so this is why a lot of players who play the game call the other modes' charts beatmaps, because of the original game.\nAlthough catch, taiko and mania do not use co-ordinate systems, similar to almost all the other modes in OutFox, they inherit the beatmap definition by players of the game.\nThroughout this page, we will be using the chart term, as we do not support the Osu Tatakae Ouendan (Mode=0) mode, as we have no way of mapping the circles/hit objects to the screen at this time.\n Layout     .osu files are constructed using sections which contain content within to describe and give information about the map or chart detailed within. Each file will only contain one set of data; it is not like SSC or DTX which can contain several charts.\nMost beatmap artists will include different difficulty levels to what they have created, usually with different mode support in some cases. This allows access to different skill levels and more availability to players, as not everyone is highly competitive or have the means to play one specific mode.\n Basic Format     The .osu file format describes how notes are arranged and how the game is meant to behave if/when a player takes a specific action. It is usually a simple plain text file with the command lines made up of key:value pairs.\nPlease note! There are 3 layouts to the pairs, which will be explained further down in the page, so if you are parsing this file, do take note about the spaces around the pairs.\nThe format consists of 8 different sections which detail specifics about the chart. We will be going through in detail on the most commonly used commands and features of this format on this page. We will not be supporting editing or creating this format; The support in OutFox is parse (read) only.\n   Section What it\u0026rsquo;s for Command / Content type Supported?

As OutFox has a very different setup and internal system, most of the options in this section do not apply. It\u0026rsquo;s here primarily for completeness and to explain what bits do.\n[General] AudioFilename: audio.mp3 AudioLeadIn: 0 PreviewTime: 35841 Countdown: 0 SampleSet: Soft StackLeniency: 0.8 Mode: 3 LetterboxInBreaks: 0 CountdownOffset: 0 SpecialStyle: 0 WidescreenStoryboard: 1  AudioFilename: filename [string]    Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\nAudioFilename: song.mp3 This entry in the list tells the game what music file to use for the chart. It will be case sensitive on Linux/Mac so bear this in mind if you have a chart which cannot find it\u0026rsquo;s music file, this will be the issue.\nThis variable is equivalent to the #MUSIC entry on SM/SSC files.\n#MUSIC:song.mp3;  AudioLeadIn: n [0-212]    Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nAudioLeadIn: 0 This entry in the list tells the game the number of milliseconds of silence to add before the first sample of the music that plays. It is used for effects or to prepare players for the beginning of the chart, however with how OutFox does timing, this would act more as an offset, and our clock system does not work in milliseconds.\nAt this time we do not plan on supporting this variable.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\n PreviewTime: n [time in ms]    Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\nPreviewTime: 35841 This value tells the game the time in milliseconds to play the preview section of the song in the music wheel. There is no separate option for a preview file in this format, so it uses a time offset based on the music file detailed in the AudioFilename entry.\nUnlike SM/SSC there is no #SAMPLELENGTH in this format that tells the game to loop or reset the point of playback. It will fall back to the default 15 second length when parsing.\nTo make this variable compatible with OutFox it needs to be divided by 1000 to get the seconds value, as per the #SAMPLESTART SM/SSC variable.\n#SAMPLESTART:35.841;  Countdown: n [0-3]    Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nCountdown: 0 The countdown happens before the beginning of the first hit object or note, allowing the option to \u0026lsquo;ready\u0026rsquo; the player before the song starts. This option allows the chart author to set 4 different speed values. Most modern day charts set this to 0 (disabled).\n  0 = Set the countdown to be disabled, so the chart will begin as soon as everything loads.     1 = Set the countdown to be normal, thus adding a 3, 2, 1\u0026hellip;GO! option that happens before the music plays. This only happens if there is an offset before the beginning from what the documentation says, so it is not always guaranteed.     2 = Sets a half speed countdown; one that is half the speed of 1.     3 = Sets a double speed countdown; one that is double the speed of 1.   At this time we do not plan on supporting this variable.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\n SampleSet: set [string]    Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nSampleSet: Normal This variable allows for the chart artist to specify a selection of sound samples to be used when setting a hit object. These sounds play when an object (note) is hit, much like keysounds in BMS or DTX modes.\nThe definition seems to imply that there are 3 base types that can be set for the whole song, and one can also change this variable in the [HitObjects] and the [TimingPoints] sections described further down.\nOutFox will honour specific hitsounds as keysounds in modes that support them, but at this time we do not have a custom sound sample pack for this command. If you wish to have this supported, do let us know for consideration!\n  Normal = Set the sound sample packs to normal.     Soft = Set the sound sample packs to softer less distracting sounds.     Drum = Set the sound sample packs to drum based sounds.   At this time we do not plan on supporting this variable.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\n StackLeniency: n.n [0.0-1.0]    Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nStackLeniency: 0.7 StackLeniency is used in the Osu Tatakae Ouendan mode to \u0026lsquo;stack\u0026rsquo; circles upon one another if they are in the same place (or within a few osupixels) as one previously drawn on the screen.\nThere is some confusion as to what this modifier actually does, and it seems this is a multiplier in time, most likely from 0-1 seconds, so the closer to 1.0 the more likely you will have a stack of circles, (which will have a number within to show the number of circles one needs to hit).\nAs the stack leniency heads towards 0 there is less chance of the \u0026lsquo;multitap\u0026rsquo; circles forming on the notefield so this I believe is what the variable is for.\nOutFox does not support the Osu Tatakae Ouendan mode, so this variable is ignored.\nIf there is anyone out there with a better/more comprehensive explanation of this variable, I\u0026rsquo;d love to have it so we can update it here. This is just my rough guess on seeing it in game - Squirrel\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\n Mode: n [0-3]    Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\nMode: 1 This command sets the game mode the chart (or map) is for.\n  0 = Sets the mode to circles, the basic Osu Tatakae Ouendan mode. The file is a beatmap with correct co-ordinates. Status:❌ Unsupported     1 = Sets the mode to taiko, a drum based game. The file is a note chart with adapted variables, drumrolls and denden multihit notes. These charts will be selectable in the Outfox taiko gamemode. Status:✅ Supported     2 = Sets the mode to catch, a vertical item drop game. The file is a item chart with adapted variables. Status:❌ Unsupported     3 = Sets the mode to mania, a vertical scrolling note game. The file is a note chart with adapted variables and holds. These charts will be selectable in the Outfox kb gamemode. Status:✅ Supported   This variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\n LetterboxInBreaks: n [0/1]    Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nLetterboxInBreaks: 0 This command controls an [Effect], such as a background or a video. Setting this to 1 will add a cinematic \u0026lsquo;letterbox\u0026rsquo; (black bars) within the edges of the screen.\nAt this time we do not plan on supporting this variable.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\n UseSkinSprites: n [0/1]    Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nUseSkinSprites: 0 This command controls a [Storyboard] setting, which sets whether or not the storyboard script can use the image files for the skin in use.\nOutFox does not plan to implement the [Storyboard] feature as we have a modding system built in already, so this setting is ignored.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\n OverlayPosition: position [string]    Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nOverlayPosition: NoChange This command affects the readability of hit circles in Osu Tatakae Ouendan mode. It allows the chart author to control how the overlays (the circle animations or hit animations) are drawn. This can make the \u0026lsquo;numbers\u0026rsquo; within the circle easier to see, as well as making stacks work slightly better for those with colour issues.\n  NoChange = Sets the mode to the default.     Below = Sets the mode to draw the effects below the numbers. This makes the value easier to read.     Above = Sets the draw above the numbers. Can affect how easy it is to read, but does look cool.   At this time we do not plan on supporting this variable.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\n SkinPreference: preference [string]    Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nSkinPreference: Ice This command allows the chart author to select a custom \u0026lsquo;skin\u0026rsquo; (theme) to use when the chart is played. This allows for a new level of immersion if your charts are based on a subject type or theme.\nAt this time we do not plan on supporting this variable.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\n EpilepsyWarning: n [0/1]    Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nEpilepsyWarning: 0 This command controls an option to show a setting to warn about flashing colours or lights before the song plays.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\n CountdownOffset: n [0-256]    Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nCountdownOffset: 28 This command sets the time (in beats) that the countdown starts before the first hit object or note.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\n SpecialStyle: n [0/1]    Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nSpecialStyle: 0 This command sets a different key layout named \u0026lsquo;N+1\u0026rsquo; for mania mode. This option is not used as apparently this can be set within the options of the actual game. Setting this requires compatible noteskins / skins to be available, and a suitable mode layout or it can render the song unplayable on the client due to missing assets.\nThis is not available in Outfox as keys can be assigned as required by the player.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\n WidescreenStoryboard: n [0/1]    Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nWidescreenStoryboard: 0 This option sets the [Storyboard] as available to be viewed as widescreen on systems that support it or not. The default is 4:3 for normal play, due to the osupixels 640x480 setup\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\n [Editor] Section     This section contains entries for the editor of Osu so won\u0026rsquo;t be used or processed in OutFox.\n [Metadata] Section     This section details the main song metadata used in the chart or beatmap that is used when caching, being used in the music wheel, saving scores, and online profiles.\nOutFox does not have some of those features yet as they are being built, but almost all of this section is used in some way within our caching, scoring and music wheel system.\nThe commands for this section are done as Command:Value.

If there is no TitleUnicode entry it will use this as the title.\nThis variable is equivalent to the #TITLETRANSLIT entry on SM/SSC files.\n#TITLETRANSLIT:My Great Song;  TitleUnicode:title [string]    Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\nTitleUnicode:私の素晴らしい歌 This entry in the list tells the game what the song title is for this chart in utf8.\nOn OutFox this entry is usually the original title, so we will be parsing this as that entry.\nThis variable is equivalent to the #TITLE entry on SM/SSC files.\n#TITLE:私の素晴らしい歌;  Artist:artist [string]    Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\nArtist:OutFox Sound Team This entry in the list tells the game what the song artist is for this chart in roman form.\nOn OutFox this entry is usually the transliterated (translation) of the artist name, so we will be parsing this as that entry. If there is no ArtistUnicode entry it will use this as the artist name.\nThis variable is equivalent to the #ARTISTTRANSLIT entry on SM/SSC files.\n#ARTISTTRANSLIT:OutFox Sound Team;  ArtistUnicode:artist [string]    Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\nArtistUnicode:「OutFox」音楽 This entry in the list tells the game what the song artist name is for this chart in utf8.\nOn OutFox this entry is usually the original artist name, so we will be parsing this as that entry.\nThis variable is equivalent to the #ARTIST entry on SM/SSC files.\n#ARTIST:「OutFox」音楽;  Creator:creator [string]    Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\nCreator:Squirrel This entry in the list tells the game the creator or author of the beatmap or chart.\nOn OutFox this entry is referred to as the chart credit, and is used as a given entry on the music wheel.\nThis variable is equivalent to the #CREDIT entry on SM/SSC files.\n#CREDIT:Squirrel;  Version:version [string]    Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\nVersion:OutFox Easy Mod File 2021 This entry in the list allows a chart author to name a difficulty \u0026lsquo;version\u0026rsquo; for the particular .osu file within a collection for one song. It is usually used for descriptive difficulty information, or to \u0026lsquo;theme\u0026rsquo; difficulties, for example (spring easy, summer hard, autumn extreme, winter death).\nOther authors use this field to also add the number of keys the chart has in mania mode, for example [3k], [6k], [10k] would let people know it uses 3 columns, 6 columns and 10 columns respectively before the difficulty name.\nThere is no specific detail given for this entry, other than it being used within the online portion of the game for difficulty and to give information on the music wheel when choosing a song. It is better to give some detail about the difficulty in the entry given, as you can risk not being ranked, and upsetting players.\nOn OutFox this entry is used for the \u0026lsquo;multi-chart per folder\u0026rsquo; setup some packs have in the new kbx mode. This gives you seamless loading capabilities without having to split up multi-song chart packs.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\n Source:source [string]    Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\nSource:Serenity Volume 2 This entry in the list identifies the source of the song, or the original media it was produced for (in the case of anime openings/themes etc). It can also be used as the pack source if the song was created specifically for games, as our example.\nOn OutFox this entry is likely going to be parsed as the \u0026lsquo;subtitle\u0026rsquo; entry until we fit another option for this information.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.    Tag:tags [string string string]    Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\nTags:japanese j-pop modfile This command adds a selection of words that the chart can be searched by on the online system, and within the music wheel. They are simply space separated, and act like tags on a youtube video or instagram post, allowing players to find the chart.\nIt is important you put useful or meaningful tags in this section that reflect the chart so it can be found!\nOutFox supports this function for chart searching in supported wheels.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.    BeatmapID:id [n]    BeatmapSetID:id [n]    Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nBeatmapID:0123456789 BeatmapSetID:0987654 The BeatmapID is used as an identifier for the \u0026lsquo;Difficulty ID\u0026rsquo; according to the official documentation, with the BeatmapSetID being used as the identification of the chart or beatmap itself.\nThe use of these is mainly for the upload content system so the web side can catalogue and add the entries to the database. Without these one would not be able to tie scores or combos to the charts played. These identifiers also are likely used for ranking and high scoring/music wheels internally for the client.\nOutFox has it\u0026rsquo;s own unique hashing system and database system planned which will be used as the IDs in this format are not compatible.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\n [Difficulty] Section     This section details the main difficulty setup that the chart or beatmap will use. There are several values which change depending on the mode type, as well as the sizes of the circles and other settings.\nOutFox will not be using many of these as they are for circles mode primarily, but the taiko and mania mode changes will be detailed here.\nThe commands for this section are done as Command:Value. Do note the lack of spaces!\n HPDrainRate:n.n [0.0-10.0]    Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nHPDrainRate:7.2 HP Drain Rate, usually shortened to HP, sets the rate of health increase or decrease depending on how a note is hit. This is usually a set amount of time before or after, which we call a timing window. The closer to the notes actual time it is hit, the high the \u0026lsquo;category\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;judgment\u0026rsquo; the game records for that hit.\nIt allows for a recovery (health is added to the life bar) on a GOOD hit or better. The scale is from 0.0 to 10.0, with lower values giving more health returns. A higher value lowers the health return gained on the note.\nIn reflection, the drain of this value, which is given when a note is hit badly is different to the value. so a lower value affects the health bar less on a bad hit, and a higher value punishes the player more.\nIn circles and catch this value can also modify the passive rate of drain. These modes have a constant drain on the life-bar. If the life bar drains to 0 the player counts as failing the chart.\nIn OutFox we do not have a life draining mechanism at this time, so this value isn\u0026rsquo;t supported. If catch mode is ever implemented this mechanism will of course be required.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\nCircleSize:n.n/n [0.0-10.0]/[0-10]    Status: ✅ Supported (mania only)\nUsage Example:\nCircleSize:3.2 CircleSize:4 Circle Size (CS) is a variable that lives a double life in the beatmaps or charts. In circles it defines the size of the hit objects, within the range of 1 to 10. Higher values helpfully make the circles smaller. In the community it is seen that the majority of the beatmaps use between 2.5 and 4.0. This is followed by 4.0 to 5.7, with values outside of these ranges almost never being used, mainly due to them being too small on some devices to hit, or just too big to make an efficient beatmap that flows with effects (Sliders/spinners overlapping etc due to scale).\nIf the chart is above 7, it is likely that one of the Osu games mods, Hard Rock is being used. Outside of this, it is very unlikely to be used. The sliders in the editor do not permit for values outside of 2.0 to 7.0, so one needs to manually edit this value in the .osu file.\nThe other life this value leads, is within the catch mode. In this mode, the Circle Size defines the size of the fruit and the catcher sprites. It works as above, higher numbers make the fruit and catch smaller. This mode usually has values between 2 and 7, which is commonly seen as 3-4.\nIf the value is set to the highest value, 10, the hit objects will be the same size as the cursor that is shown on the screen to show the location of the mouse/pointer/pen/touch etc.\nThis value is also \u0026lsquo;seen\u0026rsquo; in the taiko mode, however, it does nothing. It is also ignored in the OutFox taiko mode.\nHowever, if the mode is mania, this value becomes something completely different. In the editor it is an automatic switch to a variable called 'KeyCount'. As this mode is a vertical scrolling game, this value is the number of \u0026lsquo;keys\u0026rsquo; (on a keyboard or controller) you will be using to play that particular chart. This is also the same as the \u0026lsquo;column count\u0026rsquo; we have in OutFox.\nThe .osu file does not reflect the KeyCount word. It remains as CircleSize. The difference is, the mode uses whole numbers, so there will be no CircleSize:4.3.\nThe values used for this version of CircleSize you will see 3 to 10. This is contrary to what the official documentation says, it is not 1 to 9.\nOutFox computes these column amounts as CircleSize - 1 as our columns begin at 0. The new kb mode will support all key modes from 1 to 10, with 2 player support.\nThis variable has no equivalent SM/SSC value.\nOverallDifficulty:n.n [0.0-10.0]    Status: ✅ Supported\nUsage Example:\nOverallDifficulty:1.3 ApproachRate:n.n [0.0-10.0]    Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nApproachRate:4.8 SliderMultiplier:n.n [0.0-10.0]    Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nSliderMultiplier:3.7 SliderTickRate:n.n [0.0-10.0]    Status: ❌ Ignored (Unsupported)\nUsage Example:\nSliderTickRate:7.2  Written and Maintained with ♡ by Squirrel, containing information with thanks from the Osu!

Inner is the main use of a glyph, which is drawn character by default. Stroke is used to make bordered text without risking modification of the original glyph map, which allows for coloring on the fly.\nSetting a Text Glow Mode    When using the glow function, the BitmapText actor automatically applies the glow color to both layers by default. You can change this with the textglowmode function, which uses a TextGlowMode enumerator to determine which area to apply its glow, one or the other or both.\nHere we have applied a stroke color of green, which will make the border color green, and then a glow blue with 50% opacity. However, because the glow mode has been set to TextGlowMode_Inner, that glow will only apply to the inner layer, leaving the border untouched.\nreturn Def.ActorFrame{ Def.BitmapText{ Font = \u0026#34;_ibm plex sans cond smbld/20px\u0026#34;, OnCommand = function(self) self:xy( SCREEN_CENTER_X, 50 ) :settext( \u0026#34;i am text\u0026#34; ) :strokecolor(color(\u0026#34;#ffffff00\u0026#34;)) end } }     "},{"id":70,"href":"/dev/mode-support/sm-support/","title":"SM","parent":"NoteLoader support","content":"Project OutFox contains a parser for the SM chart format, which has existed as early as StepMania 3.9, and is what most StepMania-based engines support as a base format \u0026amp; simfile cache format. With SM5, this has been succeeded by the SSC format, but for completeness, the following page contains details about what the SM format supports and used to support.\nEvery section follows this format: #SECTION:DATA;, which means #, ; and : shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be used in the data section.\nTo note, some sections parsed are from SSC, so the current implementation of SM is both SM and a bit of SSC.\nSections    TITLE    This gives the title of the song.\nIf not defined, the game falls back on the simfile directory name.\nExample:\n#TITLE:Blow My Mind;  SUBTITLE    This gives the subtitle of the song.

Often, a last entry with \u0026ldquo;-nosongbg-\u0026rdquo; as the file is placed so the song\u0026rsquo;s starting background doesn\u0026rsquo;t show up at the end.\nExample:\n#BGCHANGES:0.000=blossom1.jpg=1.000=1=0=1===CrossFade==, 52.000=blossom2.jpg=1.000=0=0=1=====, 164.000=blossom1.jpg=1.000=0=0=1=====, 229.000=blossom3.jpg=1.000=0=0=1=====, 302.000=blossom1.jpg=1.000=0=0=1=====, 99999=-nosongbg-=1.000=0=0=0 // don't automatically add -songbackground- ; The second line explained: 52.000=blossom2.jpg=1.000=0=0=1=====\n Beat = 52 File = \u0026ldquo;blossom2.jpg\u0026rdquo; Update rate = 1 Crossfade: off stretchrewind: off stretchnoloop: on Effect: none (Does not override the above three) File2: none (Nothing loads in the second slot) Transition: none (The first line uses \u0026ldquo;CrossFade\u0026rdquo;) Color1: none Color2: none   FGCHANGES    Like BGCHANGES, FGCHANGES follow the same format, but happen in a Foregound layer, above the players and most everything else. Commonly used in gimmick files to script modifiers or other visual aspects.\nExample:\n#FGCHANGES:0.000=lua=1.000=0=0=1=====;  KEYSOUNDS    Specifies what files to load as keysounds. Uses relative paths.\nExample:\n#KEYSOUNDS:pf_24_c#+.ogg,ba_op1.ogg,dr_hho.ogg,dr_rs.ogg,dr_bd8.ogg,dr_cs8.ogg,sq_a.ogg,pc_c.ogg,pf_op11.ogg;  OFFSET    Defines when beat 0 starts, in seconds. Charts made for the ITG meta tend to have an extra positive 9 ms added.\nExample:\n#OFFSET:-0.611000;  STOPS / FREEZES    Defines where stops in the song happen. The first parameter is the beat, and the second parameter is how long the stop is, in seconds.\nExample:\n#STOPS:46.250000=0.030000, 46.500000=0.030000, 46.750000=0.030000;  BPMS    Defines the BPMs the song has. A song must have at least one BPM at beat 0.\nThe first parameter is the beat, and the second parameter is the actual BPM.\nExample:\n#BPMS:0.000=140.250, 48.000=93.500, 48.333=62.333;  TIMESIGNATURES    Defines the time signatures of the song. Most songs default to 4/4 as their starting signature. There are three parameters: beat, numerator and denominator. The last two parameters must be greater than or equal to 1.\nCurrently, this only affects the measure lines.\nExample:\n#TIMESIGNATURES:0.000=4=4;  ATTACKS    These are course-style scripted modifiers written into the simfile. Unlike most sections, this is seconds-based instead of beat-based, to allow for modifiers during stops.\nThe format of an attacks entry is this: TIME=seconds:END/LEN=endtime/lengthtime:MODS=modstring\nInternally, entries that use END are converted into LEN.\nExample:\n#ATTACKS:TIME=1.618:END=3.166:MODS=*32 Invert, *32 No Flip :TIME=2.004:END=3.166:MODS=*32 No Invert, *32 No Flip :TIME=2.392:LEN=0.1:MODS=*64 30% Mini :TIME=2.489:LEN=0.1:MODS=*64 60% Mini;  DELAYS    Specifies the Delay segments for the song. The first parameter is the beat, and the second parameter is the duration in seconds. Appears to have been added since SM-SSC.\nExample:\n#DELAYS:488.000=0.050;  TICKCOUNTS    Specifies how many checkpoints a hold has in a beat. The default value is 4. This only gets used in the pump game mode. The first parameter is the beat, and the second parameter is the number of checkpoints to use. Appears to have been added since SM-SSC.\nExample:\n#TICKCOUNTS:0.000000=4, 50.000=16;  NOTES / NOTES2    NOTES2 is written when keysounds are used, but both are read in the same way.\nNotedata specs    Notedata has 6 parameters:\n Steps Type: follows the format game-style. eg: pump-doubles Description: a string that usually has the chart creator\u0026rsquo;s name or chart information. Difficulty: The difficulty of the chart. Chart Meter: the difficulty number. Various chart metas follow different number scales. Radar Values: The 5 radar values based off of DDR\u0026rsquo;s. The order is this: Stream, Voltage, Air, Freeze, Chaos. The game calculates this itself when writing the SM file. Notes: the actual notedata the game reads in to create the chart one plays.  Special cases    There are two special cases involving the Hard difficulty. If the description is \u0026ldquo;smaniac\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;challenge\u0026rdquo;, it gets read into the Challenge difficulty.\nNote layout    Each measure has a minumum of four lines, with each measure being comma separated. The number of characters per row corresponds to the number of columns the mode has. (eg: dance-single has four columns, so each row has four characters)\n4 rows per measure allows for 4ths, 8 rows per measure allows for 8ths, 16 rows per measure allows for 16ths, etc.\nNote Types    The following table shows what character corresponds to what note type (not including characters introduced by SSC)\n   Note Character Note Type Quirks     0 empty N/A   1 Tap Note N/A   2 Hold Note Head N/A   4 Roll Note Head N/A   3 Hold \u0026amp; Roll Note Tail Having a 3 without a corresponding 2 or 4 will result in warnings.   M Mines N/A   K AutoKeysounds N/A   L Lifts N/A   F Fakes They can only be fake taps. You can\u0026rsquo;t do fake holds with this.    Attack Notes    Attacks can be attatched to notes by having {} after the note.\nThe format is {modstring:lengthseconds}\nWhen hitting a note with an attack, the attack gets applied for the player as a whole for the given duration.\nKeysounds    Keysounds can be attached to a note by having [] after the note.\nThe format is [index], with index starting at 0, and corresponding to the order listed in #KEYSOUNDS.\nExample:\n#NOTES: dance-single: Charter Man: Easy: 4: 0.503,7.2,0,0,0: L000 00F4 0000 0003 , 1000 0200 00M0 A[0]000 0300 0000 0001{tipsy,50%bumpy:5.2} 0000 ;  Deprecated / Cache Sections    These sections are considered unused or ignored in normal simfiles due to being replaced, removed or being used in cache files instead.\nMUSICLENGTH    Specifies how long the music is, in seconds. Used in the cache variant of the SM format.\nExample:\n#MUSICLENGTH:64.052;  MUSICBYTES    Just flat out ignored. No-one seems to know what this was for.  LASTBEATHINT    Specifies a custom last beat for the song. Phased out at some point. Example:\n#LASTBEATHINT:211.000000;  FIRSTBEAT    Specifies the first beat in the song. Used in the cache variant of the SM format. Phased out at some point. Example:\n#FIRSTBEAT:10.348;  LASTBEAT    Specifies the last beat in the song. Used in the cache variant of the SM format. Phased out at some point. Example:\n#LASTBEAT:128.600;  SONGFILENAME    The full path to the simfile itself. Used in the cache variant of the SM format. Moved into the SSC cache format.\nExample:\n#SONGFILENAME:/AdditionalSongs/UPS 4/Brain Power/Noma - Brain Power.sm;  HASMUSIC    Used in the cache variant of the SM format. Moved into the SSC cache format.\nExample:\n#HASMUSIC:1;  HASBANNER    Used in the cache variant of the SM format. Moved into the SSC cache format.\nExample:\n#HASBANNER:0;  SAMPLEPATH    Defines the path to the separate sample audio. Phased out at some point.  LEADTRACK    Unknown.\n"},{"id":71,"href":"/dev/theming/Theming-1-Folders/","title":"The Structure of folders","parent":"Introduction to theming","content":"A theme can consist of the following folders. All of them are optional, but needed to perform certain operations on how to load / fetch files.\nIt is important to understand that themes in newer versions of StepMania/OutFox rely on _fallback, a special theme folder located on Appearance/Themes/ which contains all of the information neccessary to run any kind of theme. Earlier in the day, since there was no such thing, every theme distributed had to contain the same information in order to run, which in term would lead to a lot of repeated code for something that was never used.\nYou can create more/less folders than this and call them in your theme by fetching the location of your theme\u0026rsquo;s folder and then accessing the data that you need, but for the purposes of this guide, we\u0026rsquo;ll stick to these folders.\nBGAnimations    Contains the lua scripts that control the visual elements of screens.

"},{"id":72,"href":"/dev/mode-support/tja-support/","title":"TJA Compatibility","parent":"NoteLoader support","content":"Project OutFox is working on support on the parser for the TJA (Taikojiro) chart format, which is the standard format used in conjunction with the taiko game types. The following page contains details on the Taiko parsing options that Project OutFox currently supports. This is a living document - it will be incomplete as Squirrel finds time to update and confirm/clarify items that are missing or unknown.\nTJA Notedata support as of Alpha 4.12.0 - NOT YET We are still designing the parser!     Headers     The mode uses a selection of headers to set up the playfield/notefield, which appear to be based off of the old BMS style loading mechanisms. We\u0026rsquo;ll list the known ones and whether or not Project OutFox supports them.\nUnlike it\u0026rsquo;s BMS History, TJA files do not use the # delimiter to begin a line. In BMS to note the title of a song, it would be #TITLE, and in TJA, it uses just TITLE. Bear this in mind if you are converting from BMS/PMS files that the parsers for other simulators will not expect the # to be used. We will list them as per what we can find out about the TJA Specification, so do check back regularly, as this information will change from time to time as we get more familiar with this game mode and the format nuances it uses.\nSomething important to note, There are no spaces after the : in the headers. If you are using a known editor, this won\u0026rsquo;t be a problem. However if you are converting from BMS/PMS, these will not have a : at all and this can lead to information being missed in the way the game parses your chart. It will also make your .tja incompatible with other taikojiro simulators.\n TITLE    This header is self explanatory, and it sets the title of the song/chart that will be played. It is very often done in SHIFT-JIS encoding on older files, however on more modern charts, this is using UTF-8 / UTF-8 BOM.\nExample:\nTITLE:My Favourite Song  SUBTITLE    This header replaces the #ARTIST tag that BMS/PMS uses, so remember to use it in this way. It again used to be written in SHIFT-JIS on older files, but please use UTF-8, as this is the standard now.\nSubtitles can be hidden on the evaluation screen by adding -- before the title begins. If you wish to show the subtitle on the evaluation screen (the default) you can add ++. It is not actually necessary to use this notation on OutFox, but for compatibility with other simulators, it is best to set this to either visible or hide. Be aware, only -- works on other simulations, so if you want to keep compatibility, do not use the other two options (++SUBTITLE/SUBTITLE).\nExample:\nSUBTITLE:My Favourite Artists To hide on evaluation:\nSUBTITLE:--My Favourite Artists To show on evaluation\nSUBTITLE:++My Favourite Artists  BPM    This header specifies the beginning or \u0026lsquo;starting\u0026rsquo; BPM (Beats Per Minute) of a song. This is the same as the #BPM used in BMS. It is usually a whole number, but floating point/decimal point is also permitted, though these are not completely in the specification.\nExample:\nBPM:145 or\nBPM:128.35  OFFSET    The offset of a song, or where you want the song to begin, is set using seconds. In Taiko mode, this will correspond to the first \u0026lsquo;beat bar\u0026rsquo; you see, then the metronome system will continue from that. If you do not use an editor that allows you to see the waveform, this can be trial and error until it is synched up. You can use negative values, to start before the song starts, or positive values, which is after the song starts. Either of these are supported.\nExample\nOFFSET:-1.785 or\nOFFSET:3.32  WAVE    This header sets the file name of the song you wish to play. You do need to bear in mind, this is case sensitive. On Linux and Mac OS specifically, you must ensure that this entry matches the file name on the disc EXACTLY, or you will be greeted with silence when in game. For OutFox, you have the choice of the following supported file formats:\n  OGG (Recommended if you wish to make your .tja compatible with other simulators) MP3 WAV OPUS FLAC   This header is similar to the #WAVzz header used in BMS, except we\u0026rsquo;re only calling the one for this mode. Do ensure your file is encoded to 44.1kHz (44,100) as some older OGG encoders can do weird things to your file. If you\u0026rsquo;re ever unsure, use the program MediaInfo which is a handy little program for mediafile information. Most simulators will not play bad or slightly corrupted files, so this is something to take into consideration when creating your chart, so take a moment to check the file is good.\nExample\nWAVE:Iliketodrum.ogg or\nWAVE:HitMeinmyFace.flac  SONGVOL    This header sets the play volume of the song when screen gameplay starts. It is independent of the game volume, or the volume you set with the F3 option. Use this sparingly! You can make the sound of your chart be bad for players if you set it too quietly for example. It defaults to 100, which is the normal setting for a sound in the game, and in other simulators as well. It is not recommended to use values over 100, as this will cause distortion and clipping in the output, and will potentially sound awful.\nExample\nSONGVOL:100  SEVOL    This header sets the play volume of the sound effects used when screen gameplay starts. It is independent of the game volume, or the volume you set with the F3 option. Use this sparingly! You can make the sound of your chart be bad for players if you set it too quietly for example. It defaults to 100, which is the normal setting for a sound in the game, and in other simulators as well. It is not recommended to use values over 100, as this will cause distortion and clipping in the output, and will potentially sound awful.\nExample\nSEVOL:100  DEMOSTART    This allows for the preview of the song file set in WAVE. It is set to play when in screen select music, (The music wheel) and will play from the point chosen here. This system mimicks the #PREVIEW system in BMS, but does not require you to load two files. It simply uses the one song file, and will play from the point selected.\nYou need to set a time within the file, or this can cause issues with some simulators. If your song file was 93 seconds long, and you set DEMOSTART:99, this can cause undesirable behaviour in other simulators. If the number is invalid in OutFox, it will just play from the beginning, so do set this right!\nExample\nDEMOSTART:22.65  LEVEL    The level entry sets the amount of stars that the player will see and this will signify the difficulty of the chart. It is set from a scale of 1 to 10, and will set the difficulty in the game. Some simulators can also take the COURSE name to set the difficulty. It is similar to how the PLAYLEVEL works in BMS. Bear in mind that maximum star ratings aren\u0026rsquo;t the same between difficulties:\n  1-5 kantan (Easy) 1-7 futsuu (Normal) 1-8 muzu (Hard) 1-10 oni/ura (Extreme)   Example\nLEVEL:4  COURSE    This header is somewhat misleading. It is in fact the difficulty of the chart, and it can be set either as a number, or by a name.\n  Easy or 0 Normal or 1 Hard or 2 Oni or 3 Edit or 4 Tower or 5 Dan or 6   Due to the competitive nature of the PC based simulators this normally defaults to oni or 3, so be warned if your chart is easier than this difficulty, and make sure you add the correct name in the course setting. It is named Extreme so this should give you an idea of the difficulty! Edit refers to Ura Oni, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any impact alone on the genre of the song.\nUra Oni is an alternative to the Oni charts, which are not necessarily harder, but can include 2 player or gimmicks. Remember OutFox\u0026rsquo;s Mod system is quite varied, and try to keep these out of your files if you wish to make them compatible with other simulators.\nTower is based on the style from the PS2 era of the game.\nThis setting is similar to how PLAYLEVEL works in BMS, but gives a finer set of controls.\nExample\nCOURSE:4 or\nCOURSE:hard  GENRE    This header works very differently to the BMS equivalent with the same name. In Taiko, you have a choice of 8 different Genres. These will then be \u0026lsquo;set\u0026rsquo; into groups depending on this value. Use UTF-8 when setting these, to ensure full compatibility across the board.\nThese names will override any settings in box.def, the configuration file.\nSeveral of the older clients need SHIFT-JIS, but if you are targeting newer simulators (and OutFox!) then the following genre names should be used:\n  J-POP This is the J-Pop genre, used for mainstream/uplifting tracks.     アニメ This is the anime genre, used for anime based songs, opening/closing credit songs, or songs based or remixed from music within an anime. In the western community, this genre also covers western animated cartoons and movies, and the \u0026lsquo;western\u0026rsquo; based animes that are produced by the like of Netflix et al.     どうよう This genre is not used that much in modern versions of the game, as it is the \u0026lsquo;nursery rhymes\u0026rsquo; genre. If you are being true to the historical versions of the game then use this genre, but most now have moved into variety and classical. They tend to be more biased towards the easier side of difficulty, as it was meant to open up the game to a younger audience.     バラエティ This genre is \u0026lsquo;variety\u0026rsquo;. It is the genre where you can put charts that do not really \u0026lsquo;fit\u0026rsquo; in anything else. In most simulators, a lot of the edit charts go into variety. A lot of songs from BMS and Touhou fit in this category.     ボーカロイド or VOCALOID The vocaloid genre has two possible entries to the genre tag, and you can use either of them. This genre is for music made using the vocaloid based virtual idol singers, including IA, Miku, Luka, Gumi etc.     クラシック This genre is for classical music or remixes of classical tracks.     ゲームミュージック This genre has all the game music charts. This can be almost anything, as long as it\u0026rsquo;s tied to a game; Boss and title music, to BGM/Ambient music, remixes and even songs from other rhythm games go in here.     ナムコオリジナル This genre is for the \u0026lsquo;Namco Original\u0026rsquo; based songs and remixes.     キッズ This genre is similar to the nursery rhymes set, with the song charts being set for kids.     段位道場の課題曲 This genre is for Danjo Dojo based charts. These are the task based charts used in some simulators. We are not sure if this setting has been used in custom charting as of yet.   Example\nGENRE:VOCALOID or\nGenre:アニメ  SCOREMODE    This tag allows the chart maker to set the game version used when it comes to setting and sorting out the final score of the song. There have been 17 Arcade versions of Taiko and this tag can specify the scoring method. Some simulators do not support score methods other than 1. However, OutFox will support the full range. On most simulators, the default is 1.\n  0 This sets Arcade Version 1 to 7 scoring: Less than 200 combo: SCOREINIT or 1000pts per note. When the player then hits 200 combo, it is SCOREINIT + SCOREDIFF, or 2000pts (1000x2 for double) for the 200+ combo bonus. So if the player scored 184 combo in a song which had 184 notes: it would be 184x1000.   Scoring Formula: SCOREINIT * COMBO (when COMBO \u0026lt; 200) + (SCORINIT + SCOREDIFF * COMBO (when COMBO \u0026gt;200) Scoring Formula: 1000 * COMBO (when COMBO \u0026lt; 200) + (2000 * COMBO (when COMBO \u0026gt; 200))   1 This sets Arcade Version 8 to 14 scoring: With this arcade version, we use the SCOREDIFF variable. The combo multiplier rises by SCOREDIFF with each 10 combo until it hits 100, then it doesn\u0026rsquo;t change unless there is a break.   Scoring Formula: SCOREINIT + max(0, SCOREDIFF * floor((min(COMBO, 100) - 1) / 10))   2 This sets the Arcade version to 0, which is similar to how 1 works, but with some different combo multipliers. This scoring system is not commonly used, but it\u0026rsquo;s included here for completeness. There are a lot more Japanese charts with this setting. This scoring system refers to the always-online HD cabinet versions between 2011 and 2020 (normally named after colours \u0026ndash; kimidori, murasaki, red, blue, green, etc)   Scoring Formula: SCOREINIT + SCOREDIFF * (if combo over 100; 8) (if combo over 50; 4) (if combo over 30; 2) (if combo over 10; 1)   3This sets the scoring to the newest taiko arcade (nijiiro) mathematically calculates score to mean all-good (dfc, =mfc/AJ/perfect) is equal to at least 1 million with combo no longer being a factor, with much more precision than AC0 (where scores of 1.2 million were possible on note-heavy charts and scores of 800k were possible on less note-heavy charts, all oni). It\u0026rsquo;s comparable to the shin-uchi/true hit mode (other than it not accounting for big notes anymore)   Scoring Formula: ((1000000-(time of balloon (sec)*100*16.6 OR hit count of balloon×100)-time of drumroll (sec)*100*16.6)/total note count/10)then unconditional carry to single digit * 10 Example\nSCOREMODE:1  SCOREINIT    This tag sets the INITial score for the scoring method. This is commonly set to 610 on Japanese charts, but many other values are seen as well. See #SCOREMODE above.\nExample\nSCOREINIT:380  SCOREDIFF    This tag sets the score DIFFerence for the scoring method. This is commonly set to 140 on Japanese charts, but many other values are seen as well. See #SCOREMODE above.\nExample\nSCOREDIFF:90  MAKER    This tag is used for the name of the chart artist. It is not often seen in the simulators options, but the tag is available for credit. Works as per #MAKER in BMS.\nExample\nMAKER:Squirrel  MAKER    This tag is used for the name of the chart artist. It is not often seen in the simulators options, but the tag is available for credit.

This document aims to provide help with porting content to and from the different versions of the game.\n\u0026ldquo;Command\u0026rdquo; format vs \u0026ldquo;Function\u0026rdquo; format    Converting commands to the newer function format is generally recommended when porting content to SM5. The following sections detail what these processes.\n\u0026ldquo;Command\u0026rdquo; format    In SM3.95 \u0026amp; related engines, commands can be defined inside xml nodes like this:\nOnCommand=\u0026#34;x,SCREEN_CENTER_X;y,SCREEN_CENTER_Y;zoom,2;rotationz,180;linear,50;rotationy,-5000;rotationx,750;rotationz,750;sleep,100\u0026#34; (Taken from WinDEU\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Golden Slaughterer\u0026rdquo; file from \u0026ldquo;WinDEU Hates You 5EVR\u0026rdquo;.)\nThis is what can be considered \u0026ldquo;Command\u0026rdquo; format, which allowed for easy chaining of actor functions tweens.\nFor a quick translation into SM5, this can be wrapped with cmd(), but this is considered bad practice and inefficient (And it\u0026rsquo;s still counted as \u0026ldquo;Command\u0026rdquo; format). However, it\u0026rsquo;s used a lot in the past, so it\u0026rsquo;s still here for backwards compatibility.\nAnother thing to note is that the functions inside this format (eg: x, rotationz, zoom, etc.) appear to be case-insensitive, all being converted to lowercase in the end. (Although in SM5, this appears to not be the case.)\n\u0026ldquo;Function\u0026rdquo; format    In SM5, commands can be defined inside lua tables like this:\nOnCommand= function(self) self:x(SCREEN_CENTER_X):y(SCREEN_CENTER_Y):zoom(2):rotationz(180):linear(50):rotationy(-5000):rotationx(750):rotationz(750):sleep(100) end (The function format version of the earlier command)\nThis is what can be considered \u0026ldquo;Function\u0026rdquo; format.\nThis is not exclusive to SM5, however. SM3.95 \u0026amp; friends can use lua functions inside xml nodes. But there is a caveat: Actor function chaining as seen in the example is not possible in SM3.95/OpenITG/NotITG. Instead, a separate self: would be needed for each function call.\nEverything is case-sensitive in this format, so take care to ensure the casing is corrent.\nActor Differences    Because the internals of the engines are different, actors may work differently with the same lines of code.\nZoom and rotation order     SM3.95 (and as a result, OpenITG \u0026amp; NotITG) apply the rotation, then apply the zoom.  SM5 applies the zoom and then applies the rotation.\nIn Project OutFox, this can be worked around by setting the rotafterzoom attribute to false, returning the SM3.95 behavior.\nThe notes \u0026amp; receptors already have this active to help with easilly replicating modifier effects from the other engines.\nIn SM5.2 and earlier, this has to be done with wrapper states or actorframes. This is done by having the wrapper do the positioning and zooming, while the main actor gets everything else. (This is still doable in Project OutFox if you\u0026rsquo;re aiming to write content for multiple SM5s)\nZoom\u0026rsquo;s effect on the axis    SM3.95\u0026rsquo;s zoom function only affected the x \u0026amp; y axis, while zoom affects all three axis in SM5.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s fine for actors like Sprites or BitmapTexts, but it stops being \u0026lsquo;normal\u0026rsquo; when actors like Models come into play.\nThis not only affects actors, but also affects modifiers that play with zoom (eg: Mini, Tiny).\nA workaround is to either use only the x \u0026amp; y zooms or undo any scaling done to the z axis when performing a normal zoom.\nActorFrameTexture\u0026rsquo;s capture method.    In NotITG, an ActorFrameTexture (AFT), captures everything that was rendered before it and places it into a texture.\nSM5\u0026rsquo;s AFT captures everything inside of it (Hence, ActorFrameTexture), and places that into a texture.\nThis difference makes for a nontrivial challenge to port content across if AFTs are in use.\nDue to how AFTs work in nITG, lumikey or chromakey shaders are needed if transparent textures of an actor are needed.\nAttribute renames    A few of the attributes got renamed, so when porting content, take care to ensure these are dealt with:\n  effectdelay (SM3.95) becomes effect_hold_at_full (SM5)\n  hidden(0) and hidden(1) (SM3.95) becomes visible(false) and visible(true) (SM5)\n  Scaling across multiple themes    Most themes made for the SM3.95 era are considered \u0026ldquo;480p\u0026rdquo; because it\u0026rsquo;s internal height was always 480 pixels.\nSM5 changes this, with SM5.1\u0026rsquo;s default theme shifting towards a hight of 720 pixels, which can be considered an \u0026ldquo;HD\u0026rdquo; Theme.\nSeveral things have to be scaled in accordance to this, such as:\n Zoom (All axis are involved) Positioning (All axis are involved) Effects (Not all need to be scaled.)   A Common ratio would be this: SCREEN_HEIGHT/intended_height (for SM3.95-style content, intended_height is 480)\nHowever, this does not apply to every actor. If an actor is inside something that\u0026rsquo;s already scaled (eg: the NoteField inside the scaled Player), it does not require the above scaling.\nModifier Differences    Some modifiers have completely different behavior, which can make porting modifier-related content less trivial.\nTiny     In SM5, positive tiny brings the columns together similar to what Mini visually does.  NotITG instead only zooms the notes.\nThe only options are to combine column movement modifiers to counteract the movement, use the column-specific variants instead, or use tinyx \u0026amp; tinyy (which is technically closer to what nITG\u0026rsquo;s Tiny actually does).\nThis only affects the original Tiny modifier, and not its' variants.\n The zoom equation is different. SM5 uses this equation: 0.5^strength, while NotITG uses this one: 1 - 0.5*strength. (100% == 1.0 for the strength)  It just so happens that NotITG\u0026rsquo;s equation is the exact same one Mini uses for notefield zoom.\nIn OutFox, this can be altered with the TinyUsesMiniCalc sub-modifier. When active, it switches to NotITG\u0026rsquo;s equation, which allows for a wider range of zooms.\nIn SM5.2 and earlier, this can be somewhat replicated by taking the two equations and solving for the equivalent strength. (Doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for negative strengths in NotITG, through)\nThis affects every variant of Tiny.\nDifferences from older SM5 builds    Project OutFox changes the default behavior from the older SM5 builds. This section documents those changes.\nColumn-specific function changes    Instead of typing \u0026lt;mod name\u0026gt;\u0026lt;\\column number\u0026gt; (As in SM5.1), you now type \u0026lt;Mod Name\u0026gt;Col, and the first parameter is the column number. It also allows for mass applications by passing nil as the column number.\nPlayer vanish point    In SM5.2 and earlier (due to a math error), the player\u0026rsquo;s vanish point at the x axis is skewed towards their side of the screen instead of being directly at the center of the notefield. This is not an issue in SM5.0.7 and earlier or in OutFox and later.\nFor example: P1 is at the left half of the screen, so its' vanish point is slightly skewed towards the left edge of the screen.\nvibrate() now takes the current zoom into account    This is similar to how it behaves in SM3.95/ITG.\nSM5.1 and earlier take the endpoint zoom and use that for vibrate.\nFor example:\nactor:vibrate():zoom(20):linear(2):zoom(0) Would result in no visible vibration because the end point is 0, while in OutFox and SM3.95, one would see the vibration start at 20 and go down as the zoom reaches 0.\nLua is more strict with escape sequences.    In older builds of SM, an invalid escape sequence is ignored, with the offending \\ removed. In Lua 5.3 (and consequentally, Project OutFox), this now causes a lua error, which may result in themes or effect files not running correctly or at all.\n"},{"id":74,"href":"/dev/effects/EffectFiles-ChartSegments/","title":"Chart segments","parent":"Effect Simfiles","content":"Gimmick charts often involve a large amount of BPM changes or stops to create various effects like stutters, wave-type scrolling or switching notes with other types of notes (ex: notes become mines).\nThis is done with \u0026ldquo;segments\u0026rdquo;.

Some songs do change BPM throughout, but some charts do this for doing stutters (when combined with stops) or having notes speed towards or slow down. Visually ignored if CMod is used (But may result in weird spacing with regards to note quantization).\nIn the simfile, it\u0026rsquo;s listed as the beat the change happens, and then the BPM to change to.

This can be useful for elements that want to, for example, have no involvement with the engine at all, and want to process information with your own custom code.\nCreation of screen definitions    For this, you will need to add the following to the metrics.ini file, mentioned on a previous chapter.\n# This will be the name for the screen, which we can access in a moment using a metric command or lua. [MyCustomScreen] # This will determine what elements will take for loading as a failsafe once it begins. # For this example, we\u0026#39;ll use ScreenWithMenuElements. Fallback=\u0026#34;ScreenWithMenuElements\u0026#34; As you notice, we\u0026rsquo;re using the Fallback item. This is to have an existing screen as a fail-safe which makes the engine call existing elements that this new screen does not have at the moment, such as its screen overlays, sounds, graphics, etc. By using this, it also fetches its class. Every single screen created must contain some kind of class, otherwise the engine will not know how to respond to it and crash or send out an error. If you are unsure which class to use, you can rely on ScreenWithMenuElements, as it is the most basic screen class type, and the skeleton for every other class.  Acessing the screen    Now with the metric information added, we have to have a way to enter the screen. There are mainly 3 ways to send the user to the screen.\nMethod 1: Using InitialScreen    This method will make the screen be the first one loaded as soon as the engine is loaded, which is useful for testing elements that may require a full restart or need quick access to such screen when performing extensive development.\nFor this, the following needs to be added to the metrics.ini file.\n[Common] # Replace the string with the name of your new screen. InitialScreen=\u0026#34;YourScreenName\u0026#34; Method 2: Using metrics    This makes use of an existing ScreenSelectMaster object to use one of its Choice option commands to include the new screen. For this example, we\u0026rsquo;ll use a ScreenTitleMenu metric set, which only contains the minimum to modify what the choices will perform.\n[ScreenTitleMenu] # ChoiceNames will deal with what are options to create on the scroller. # Notice that some of the options here are not present below, and that\u0026#39;s because # _fallback will take care of filling that information in as a fail-safe.

Project OutFox builds upon the existing StepMania 5.0.12/5.1 beta codebase, and maintaining backwards compatibility with older content is one of our main priorities. Content that worked on StepMania 5.0.12/5.1 (including songs, themes, and noteskins) should still work on OutFox. If you experience any issues/weirdness, please report it to us.\nSide note for developers\nPlease note that we are deprecating the use of semicolon-separated cmd() blocks (i.e. OnCommand=cmd(linear,1.5;diffusealpha,1); ) as a means of placing commands on actors in Lua scripts, as this method is a non-standard Lua function that was created for StepMania, and OutFox is not optimized with this coding style in mind (themes may experience performance penalties if they use this method). It is strongly recommended that function chaining (i.e. code such as OnCommand=function(self) self:linear(1.5):diffusealpha(1) end, ) be used instead.\nCan I install it alongside existing versions?    Yes. Our installer on Windows also defaults to portable mode, so user profile data is stored in your installation directory.\nIf you would like to have a shared song library between multiple builds, you can use the AdditionalSongFolders preference in Save/Preferences.ini to specify a path.

What is StepMania 5.2 and why did you skip over it?    StepMania 5.2 was originally intended to be the next version. However, it included a number of major changes that broke compatibility with previous versions, and were not well-received by the community and other developers.\nStepMania 5.2 was originally meant to be 5.1. However, in response to the reception, it was officially delayed in favour of a new 5.1 that was largely an update to 5.0.12 that did not break compatibility with existing content. This was done under the presumption that the new version (subsequently renamed 5.2) would eventually be completed. However, this did not end up happening.\nQ: How do I get logs?

Project OutFox uses XInput, it means controllers need to get mapped first and then never again.

Chart: How we call Songs that you can play in OutFox. (osu! players calls them Maps) Mods: Modded charts that uses Lua to change how the game operates. Pad Chart/Keyboard Chart: If the chart was design for people that play in pad or for keyboard. Hold: A note that you have to hold to not miss it. Drill/Roll: A note that you have to keep hitting to not miss it. NG: Missed Hold/(Drill or Roll) Doublestep: When you have to use the same foot to hit 2 different notes. RUDRU for example (R = Right, U = Up, D = Down) Ghosttap: When you hit a place where there\u0026rsquo;s no step. 4th,8th,12th: Note types and colors, 4th: red arrow (hit after each beat), 8th: blue arrow (hit after each half beat), 12th: green arrow (hit after each 1/3 beat)..it goes on. Playfield/Notefield/Receptors/PlayerBoards: The targets that notes are going to reach. In dance, the 4 notes that are always at the top. In pump, the 5 notes that are always at the top. Lifts: Note that you have to stop holding the moment they reach the playfield.  Q: Will Project OutFox go open source?    Yes.\nFrom Squirrel:\n The project began as a method to add online and profiles to SM5, but when we looked into the engine to see how this could be appropriated it was discovered just how much in a sorry state the code base was, and it looked mostly abandoned. I spoke to Shakesoda in hopes of a resurrection in the form of a team project, and it was requested rather than breaking 10 years of content and community to take the time to make a proper 5.x build that is stable and supports what the community as a whole wants from the game. This backward compatibility support has been an absolute git to do, but it\u0026rsquo;s something now we are down the line which we are proud of, as it has brought many players and newcomers to the community, and provided a very stable experience for folks during the lockdown. We will continue to maintain a near 100% compatibility where we can, and this is taken into consideration whenever we plan a new feature or change engine components.\n  In the beginning of the project we wanted to be the natural progression of 5.1, but due to resistance and feedback from the community, we have made the decision to adjust the returning of code back to the repo in the future. The aim has always been to open source when we get to Alpha 7.0, which gives us enough time to realise our plans for the project and the direction we chose to take OutFox in. We read the community loud and clear in terms of their wishes and needs for StepMania, so we will not disturb that paradigm.\n  We asked if it was ok to close the source while this process was done, and it was deemed wise for the health of the repo and the need of people who are just wanting to play. Its why we\u0026rsquo;ve been around the repo but not on it as taint can happen and we do not wish this. SSC did this same behaviour before us, so we did not see it as a problem. Some vocal members of the community disagreed, including some of the SMDev Team. We have also been compared to past SM repo contributors who may have left a less than savoury memory in the minds of some, and it has also been hard to differentiate from history we have no involvement with.\n  Moving forward with the project, it has become apparent that OutFox has moved beyond a lot of what the community expects StepMania to be, so there will be a different ideal on the opening of source code to the StepMania Repo itself. We have had to \u0026lsquo;rename\u0026rsquo; our internal system away from StepMania, this was due to us wishing to licence/digitally sign the binaries we make, and with gaining this with the SM name being almost impossible, we had to change name to OutFox. Moving forward we continue to keep this promise to ensure our builds are signed on Mac OS (and soon Windows) so it makes the game play experience better for everyone.\n  The project is about providing a free game with unencumbered assets and also packs of properly licenced content for the community, and this covers more than dance alone. We are not for profit, we do not ever wish to profit from this community, as we have been part of it for so long. We will announce more information in due course about our future, for now we are as excited as you on the progression of this project.\n My controller doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, but it did on older versions of StepMania.    Currently the game features two modes: a HIDAPI-based \u0026ldquo;Legacy\u0026rdquo; input system, similar in behaviour to the input system seen in StepMania 5.0, and an XInput-compliant input system (additional configuration is needed to use unrecognized controllers in this mode, see here for more information). If you are unable to map any buttons to the game, try switching modes to Legacy, available as an option in the Experimental Settings menu, or follow the guide mentioned above on how to map your controller with XInput.\nQ: I have a really recent processor and my game is having a lot of problems, why is that?    Outfox reached a point of optimization that good processors are going to have some problems because some parts of the game are going too fast and need catch up. The current solution to this is to have something running in the background (Have a video playing, other programs) to keep the processor busy.\nThis is going to have a proper fix later.\nQ: Is online mode available yet? If not, is it coming?    Short answer: no it\u0026rsquo;s not available, yes it\u0026rsquo;s coming. Long answer: It\u0026rsquo;ll take a while, the engine is still being optimized and the online system is still in development (being done by Cube).\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean Online isn\u0026rsquo;t important for us, it\u0026rsquo;s a lot, it was one of Team Rizu first plans but the engine just wasn\u0026rsquo;t ready for their plans.\nResume: As your read this, both the game engine and online mode are still in development.\nQ: How do I insert Noteskins/Themes/Avatars/Judgments/Toasties into Project OutFox?    In the game folder there\u0026rsquo;s a folder called Appearance, where you\u0026rsquo;ll find a folder for each of those mentioned features.\nFor Avatars    Open Avatars folder and drop any png, jpg, gif into there with any name you want. Now in-game go into Options \u0026gt; Profiles \u0026gt; Select any already created profile (or create one) \u0026gt; edit \u0026gt; change avatar image, now you can select any image that is inside the Avatars folder.\nFor Themes    Open Themes folder and drop here any theme that supports 5.x\nFor Noteskins    Open NoteSkins folder, open the folder that represents what noteskin gamemode the noteskin is made for, drop the NoteSkin Folder there.\nYou can find more noteskins in https://projectoutfox.com/addons/noteskins\nFor Judgments    Open Judgments, drop the judgment image there. Do not change the name of the judgments you download, they\u0026rsquo;re important so the game knows what part of the image the game should get)\nFor Toasties    Open Toasties, drop the game Toastie folter there. (The game can come with 2 toasties in the installer options)\nQ: I have an ancient Intel Card and the game does nothing but crash!    If your log shows WDDM1.0 or WDDM1.1 at the end of the graphics card name:\n00:00.505: Last seen video driver: Intel(R) 82945G Express Chipset Family (Microsoft Corporation - WDDM 1.0) or the log shows Microsoft GDI as the Renderer\nThen you are running the OpenGL crippled \u0026lsquo;windows\u0026rsquo; driver that is downloaded on a fresh install. Project OutFox will not work on these drivers, as we do not support DirectX anymore (the old D3D renderer that 5.0.12/5.1 has)\nThere is a list of drivers at this site location that may help, but for some of these cards, you need to keep your windows 7 install disc handy!\nhttps://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005733/graphics.html\nUpdate: If you accidentally updated your windows to beyond the support given to you by Intel, so you moved to windows 8.1/10 from 7 then there is still hope! you can take a chance with the Mesa OpenGL replacer for legacy software, which adds an API extension over Microsoft. You can find it here: https://github.com/pal1000/mesa-dist-win/releases/latest\nHOW TO USE?\nDownload Mesa3d for Windows: mesa3d-xxxx-release-msvc.exe\n Extract it (either with a double-click or right-click 7-zip) In the extraction folder of Mesa, go to x64, select and copy opengl32.dll In the extraction folder of Project OutFox, go to /program and paste opengl32.dll it may now use the proper dll  Also see https://fdossena.com/?p=mesa/index.frag for a windows working solution.\nAnd for a detailed guide for intel users: (Some computer literacy needed) https://gist.github.com/rb-dahlb/26f316c5b6089807a139fc44ee69f0d1\nQ: How can I know who works on OutFox and who to trust?    Everyone on this list is part of OutFox Team and works on OutFox: see list\nInternational Moderators/Translators/Alpha Testers/Tiny-Foxes indirectly helps OutFox development but they aren\u0026rsquo;t part of the OutFox Team.\nIf you see anyone else saying they work on OutFox then do not trust and please report to us. You can always ask at our Discord Server\nLinux    I get the error \u0026ldquo;error while loading shared libraries: libOpenGL.so.0:\u0026rdquo;    Install either libglvnd and/or libopengl0 based on your distro. On some distros the package is known as libglvnd-opengl.\nMac    I\u0026rsquo;m having issues launching the game.    If you receive errors such as \u0026ldquo;No noteskins found\u0026rdquo; or other unusual behavior, you will have to change macOS security settings in order for Project OutFox to operate correctly. MacOS performs a process every time a new program has been downloaded called quarantine, which will require Gatekeeper (The OS\u0026rsquo;s security manager) to verify its signature. The OS does not trust unsigned applications, and prevents access to external files unless given manual permission by the user.\nTo do this, open Terminal and run the following command: xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/StepMania, replacing /path/to/StepMania with the path to the directory containing the StepMania executable (manually typing it out, or dragging the folder containing the game executable directly onto the window to fill it automatically).\nQuarantine video example\nOn older builds, macOS Catalina also generated a message stating that the game was requesting permission to receive keystrokes from any application. This was a side effect of previous code that has since been removed.\nThe game is rendering small in the bottom corner of the window.    This is due to the renderer not supporting scaled screens yet. To fix this, right-click the game executable and select \u0026ldquo;Get info\u0026rdquo; (or highlight the file and press Command (⌘)+I, and toggle the \u0026ldquo;Open in Low Resolution\u0026rdquo; option under General.\nWhat modes does OutFox currently support?

The familiar 7K setup we know and love was added later in 2005.\nThe mode did not see much use and fell into having a broken notesloader around the summer of 2010, making it not work with older BMS files, or files with BME or BML extensions. Many files were misinterpreted or just did not load at all, and some were even seen as pomu songs when they were not. The overdue revamp of the loading system in 2021 fixed many of these bugs, allowing this mode to function and flourish once more.

Some of these instructions assume usage of the included default theme (Soundwaves).\nSelecting a game type    When launching Project OutFox for the first time or without save data present, you will be prompted to select which game type you would like to begin with. Project OutFox supports a variety of game types, which you can learn about here, which simulate different types of rhythm games (including button layouts and, where applicable, gameplay behaviours specific to the game type). Game types are further divided into styles, which include chart types such as single, double, etc.\nTip: You can switch between game types at any time using the \u0026ldquo;Select Game\u0026rdquo; button on the main menu.  Configuring your controls    Each game type has its own default keyboard configuration; dance, for example, maps the first player to the arrow keys (when playing on keyboard, this is often referred to as the \u0026ldquo;index\u0026rdquo; playstyle). To configure your button mappings, go to Options \u0026gt; Input \u0026amp; Calibration \u0026gt; Config Key/Joy Mappings.\nUse the arrow keys to select an item to map, press Enter, and then press the button on the keyboard or controller you want to use. You can have multiple button assignments for each command.\nProject OutFox supports a wide variety of controllers and even arcade hardware. By default, the game operates with a HIDAPI and XInput-compliant input engine. If your controller does not perform as well or function as expected, you can switch to the alternate XInput input mode from the Experimental Options menu. XInput will sometimes also require you to map your controller to the input engine\u0026rsquo;s virtual gamepad, allowing the game to properly interface with the device. The Map Controller screen is available from the Input \u0026amp; Calibration menu.\nCalibrate your audio sync    !\u0026gt; Notice: Interactive calibration only works under the dance game type. If you are using a differtent game type, temporarily switch to dance, and switch back when you are done.\nIn a rhythm game, timing is everything. But latency produced by your audio outputs can affect your accuracy. You can interactively adjust the audio offset using the Calibrate Audio Sync option in the Input \u0026amp; Calibration menu.\nA song will play with a pattern of alternating notes; in the dance game type, they will be left and right arrows. Tap them to the rhythm based on what you hear. Every 24 notes, your inputs will be used to calculate a new offset; watch for \u0026ldquo;Perfect\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Flawless\u0026rdquo; judgements.\nThe song will continue playing on a loop until you exit with the Back button (mapped to Escape by default), after which you will be given an opportunity to save the changes. If you wish to calibrate in-game with your song of choice, you can press F6 twice during gameplay to enable AutoSync Machine, which will last until the end of the song or when exited with the Back button. A message will appear asking to confirm your changes and if you wish to apply them or not.\nCreate a profile    While Project OutFox can save some data to a global \u0026ldquo;machine profile\u0026rdquo;, it is recommended that you create a local profile so you can save personal high scores, as well as player settings (such as modifiers) that can persist between sessions.\nYou can manage profiles from Options \u0026gt; Profiles. From here you can create a profile, and edit existing profiles.\nFrom the profile editor (highlight a profile and press Start, and then select \u0026ldquo;Edit profile\u0026rdquo;), you can input fitness-related information, change the layout of the optional \u0026ldquo;Detailed Stats\u0026rdquo; pane during gameplay, and add an avatar to your profile (avatars are loaded from the Appearance/Avatars directory).\nInstall songs    While Project OutFox does include a few sample songs, you will probably want to add more. We support a number of formats, including SM, SSC, SMA, DWI, BMS, DTX, .CHART, and KSF.\nThe Songs folder in Project OutFox is divided into Groups (also sometimes known as \u0026ldquo;packs\u0026rdquo;). Groups, in turn, contain folders for each song.\nSongs │ └───My Group │ │ │ └───My Song │ │ mysong.ssc │ │ mysong.ogg │ │ mysong-bg.png │ │ mysong-bn.png │ │ mysong-jk.png Packs are typically distributed as ZIP files. Extract the archive with your preferred software, and copy the group folder containing the song directories to the Songs folder like so.\nNote: If the songs do not appear, be sure to check if the group folder actually containing the song folders is too deep in the folder hierarchy.  Note: If a song is not contained inside a group folder, but instead on the root Songs directory, the game will stop loading to let you know of the Song folder in question.  Next steps    The only thing left to do is have fun!

Game types are further divided into styles, which defines chart types (such as the number of columns used, single or double, vs, number of players etc.)\nThis page will give a little more detail and history about the modes that we support, and new additions and tweaks added to Project OutFox that you may have not noticed. Click on a button below for mode specific information in more detail, and to learn a bit about how the mode has evolved.\nAs of OutFox-alpha-4.10.0, they include:\nDance Pad Based Modes:     dance - The default game type. Similar to games such as Dance Dance Revolution and In the Groove, it uses four lanes in the cardinal directions (left, down, up, right). It also contains a 6-lane style (solo) adding up-left and up-right directions, and a 3-lane style using only up-left, down, and up-right. pump - A five-lane dance game, which uses four diagional directions and the center rather than cardinal directions. In terms of functionality and behavior it is in line with Pro/StepMania 4 CVS. techno - A dance game type designed for pads with nine panels, including 4-lane (similar to dance), 5-lane (similar to pump), 8-lane (using all but the center panel), and 9-lane styles in single and double versions. ds3ddx - A dance game whose format is common among Chinese arcade dance games, which uses four diagional foot panels, and four hand sensors around the pad in the cardinal directions. kickbox - Obscure lash-a-soft dance pad-to-a-punching-bag mode (four, six, and eight-sensor modes).  Sensor Based Modes:     para - A dance game designed for para para routines, which is typically played with five infrared hand sensors in a semicircular layout, and uses a considerably looser scoring system. It is modelled upon the mechanics of the defunct arcade dance game Para Para Paradise. ez2 - A game type based on the defunct arcade dance game EZ2Dancer, which uses three foot panels and a pair of hand sensors. maniax - A game type based on the defunct arcade dance game Dance Maniax, which uses four hand sensors arranged into two columns (upper and lower).  Controller Based Modes:     bms - Formally beat Supports 5-key and 7-key styles, and the ability to load BMS files. Full BME/BML support is coming soon. pomu - Formally popn A PMS player mode, supporting 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9-button styles, and the ability to load PMS files. kbx - A 1 to 15 lane game type designed primarily for keyboard play, being able to play songs from any mode using the smartGen system. This is a OutFox-specific game type that does not emulate any specific game. gddm - A drum mode supporting six-part (five drums and one pedal), nine-part (seven drums, bass pedal, hi-hat pedal), and 10-part (\u0026ldquo;Real\u0026rdquo;) styles, modelled upon the mechanics of the arcade rhythm game Drummania). We support the DTX file format, which is used with simulators for the game such as DTXMania. gdgf (formerly guitar prior to OutFox-alpha-4.9.8) - A guitar mode supporting three-fret and five-fret styles, modelled upon the mechanics of the arcade rhythm game GuitarFreaks. gh - A five-fret guitar mode modelled upon the mechanics of once-popular console games originating from North America. taiko - A \u0026ldquo;don da don\u0026rdquo; styled mode. Support for .TJA files will added in the future.  These pages below are a work in progress! Please be patient while we work on updating them! - Squirrel    Dance Pad Modes    dance   pump   techno   ds3ddx   kickbox    Sensor Based Modes    para   ez2d   maniax    Controller Based Modes    beat   pomu   kbx   gdgf   gh   gddm   taiko     Future game types    These are proposed and are scheduled on the roadmap. Limitations or code problems may delay or change these modes, so there is no date or ETA given.\n drum - A MIDI-based drum mode with 20 parts simulating a full Yamaha DTX drum kit. karaoke - A (\u0026hellip;do i need to explain this?) singing mode. Will happen if Squirrel gets off his butt. jam - A mode properly supporting o2Jam and its modes, with full .OJM loader support. piu - A major refactoring to make it more accurate to the mainline series. ppr - An obscure \u0026lsquo;Plug in!\u0026rsquo; TV based cartridge marble game from 2001. djh - A Hero isn\u0026rsquo;t always needed, neither are the DJs d86 - Feet dance Station Radio 3 panel  Written and Maintained with ♡ by Squirrel\n"},{"id":95,"href":"/dev/theming/Theming-3-Anatomy-Screen/","title":"Anatomy of a screen","parent":"Introduction to theming","content":"A screen generarly consists of 4 separate elements, and 3 special transitional elements, which are its layers. These can contain any kind of object, so they can be Lua scripts, images, video, you name it. These follow a draw order rule to display them.\nFrom draw on top to last (Marked red are the transition-specific layers):   graph LR In:::Transition -- Out:::Transition -- Cancel:::Transition -- Decorations -- Overlay -- Underlay -- Background; classDef Transition fill:#f55  To create a file for a specific layer, just name the file as [ScreenName] [layer kind], so for example a Lua file that will control the Overlay layer from ScreenTitleMenu.\nScreenTitleMenu overlay.lua An important thing to mention with screen layers is: every layer MUST return a table. This is needed so the screen manager can create the screen, so either an empty table or an ActorFrame with any kind of content will do. For in-depth information on how to create an ActorFrame base, check ActorFrames and how to build them.\nDue to this draw order, keep in mind that objects created on higher levels will always be shown first before the others.  This layering rule also has rules on how objects behave on those layers, with Decorations being the one more reserved for specific elements.\nBackground Layer    The lowest drawn layer, being the first drawn. Can be used to elements that will contain visual glare for movement. A rule for this layer is its method for loading, which is cached. This means that any moment that changes are applied, they will not be shown until the user goes to a different screen that does not contain the same background file.\nUnderlay / Overlay    The middle layers, where most objects will reside. This can be used for main elements that the user can interact with, or crucial information. No special rules are in these layers, so they can used for all general Lua scripting.\nDecorations    A specifically-visual layer, where objects can be placed for decorations. Most actions are limited on this layer:\n Lua based input is not available on this layer, as no input is ever sent. Transitional commands are not allowed. Instead, only the initial Init, On and Off commands are allowed.  In / Out / Cancel    Pure visual layers that serve as entrace, exit and backing out of a screen respectively. They are run as soon as the screen has to perform a change that will end up unloading itself.\n Lua based input is not available on this layer, as no input is ever sent. For Cancel, the transition command to run the animation uses StartTransitioningCommand. Using OnCommand or InitCommand will make the animation run as soon as the screen is loaded.

OH NO! (I will get to this)    Test your input, see if your keys are mapped and if so which ones. By pushing the buttons on the pad it’ll say something to the effect of “Key B 12 – Not Mapped” and if you step/press on the key and nothing shows up it’s not mapped, no big proceed to the next step to set it up.\nStep 2: The Easy Way    So on to the good stuff; OutFox has a built in gamepad tool that will automatically take care of most of this for you\nYou push “Enter” on the keyboard and push the appropriate button on the dance pad/etc. to map the buttons to the button you want.\nI would recommend using this screen for most controllers on pc, it takes a lot of the guess work out of the whole thing. After setting this up repeat Step 1 if your keys show up as “Unmapped” that’s great go to the “Config Key/Joy Mappings” and do your thing, you’re done with the guide!\nIf it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026hellip;\nStep 3: The not super intuitive way (SDL2 Gamepad Tool)    There is a nifty tool around called SDL2 Gamepad Tool. You connect your controller (via USB or Bluetooth or however you desire to connect your controller to the PC), and it’ll show up on the top drop down menu.\n Click \u0026ldquo;Create a New Mapping\u0026rdquo; Step/Press the input you want for those buttons much like you would on Step 2 of this procedure. Skip the rest. Save the Mapping String. Copy the Mapping String. Go to where you installed the game, and paste the string into Data/gamecontrollerdb.txt  A note    The “#” is useful for when you want to have different Mapping Strings for the same gamepad, it basically hides the mapping string from the program reading it. I made 3 different mapping for testing the the program would only recognize one, then I hid the mapping string with a hashtag (pound symbol for you oldies around) and the one not hidden was now seen by the program.\nBasically, don’t do multiple mapping strings on the same controller (even if you change the name); the program will work with one at a time and honestly one is all you need. You should be good to go and repeat Step 1 and then go to “Config Key/Joy Mappings” right after and set up your pad.\nStill isn\u0026rsquo;t working?    This hasn’t quite happened to me (I tried with the PS3 DDR mat) but there are 2 types of controllers, a “Hat” type and not. So let’s say for example you hook up a pad/controller and the Dpad you configured up down left and right but “Config Key/Joy Mappings” only allows you to push one of them and the rest don’t work.\nTry configuring the directions to the analog stick instead and then mapping them again. I don’t think you should have to but it works, I’ve tested this with my PS4 Controller and in fact you can play with analog input.\nXInput interfering with HIDAPI mode, and breaking axis pads    If you have an axis pad which is showing two sets of buttons, or simply just cancelling out, and you cannot seem to map it in game, this is what you need to do to fix it. The pad showing two buttons will look like this:\nI am pressing the left Arrow, but getting two sets of inputs. On Linux and MacOS, this can be due to an installed xbox360 driver, or the xpad module intercepting the events, and reporting an axis anyway. The next patch of OutFox mitigates this issue a little bit, but it still is a pain.\nTo fix this, you need to write down the BUTTON numbers shown on screen, so you get a list for all four arrows:\nDown=Joy1_Button 2 Left=Joy1_Button 1 Right=Joy1_Button 4 Up=Joy1_Button 3 Make sure that you close the game.

Modifiers (or Mods) apply all kinds of effects to the notes in a song - they can make the notes scroll in different directions, bounce to the beat, and many, many more things!\n You can manually turn on modifiers on any song by entering the player options menu (press start twice when you pick a song to play), and choosing Modifiers then Exit at the bottom. Mods in the Acceleration, Effects, Appearance, and Scroll categories work best for attacks - feel free to play around!\n Attacks are one of the easiest ways to add Modifiers to your simfile - Attacks will apply whatever mods you want at specific times you set in the song!\nFor StepMania 5/Outfox-based arcade cabinets (and SM5-based games like PIU Infinity), Attacks can even be used in USB custom songs and charts (if enabled)!\nAdding Attacks to a Simfile    We\u0026rsquo;ll assume you\u0026rsquo;ve already created a simfile, and know a bit about how to use the editor here.\nFirst off:\n  Open a Simfile in the Outfox editor (Title Screen \u0026gt; Edit/Share \u0026gt; Edit Songs/Steps). Pick a song, then pick a difficulty (chart).\n  When editing the chart, press Enter where you want the Modifier to start.\n  Choose Modifiy attacks at current beat at the bottom of the menu.\n   Choose Add Attack\n  Here, you\u0026rsquo;ll enter a Modifier to get applied:\n Many modifiers from the Player Options menu will work (Beat, Drunk, etc), for now just type Beat and press Enter. Any attacks you add will show up to the right of the notes, both when editing and playing a simfile in the editor.     Press P to play your song - you should see the attack you added scroll up the screen with the notes.\n When the attack with your Beat modifier scrolls to the top of the screen, the arrows will start bouncing to the beat!     Editing/Removing Attacks    Attacks only last a few seconds by default - to make it last longer you\u0026rsquo;ll need to edit the attack\u0026rsquo;s length.\nEdit an Attack      In the editor, go to the beat where the Attack you want to edit is, and press Enter.\n  All Attacks on that beat are listed - pick the one you want to edit (arrow keys/enter).\n If you don\u0026rsquo;t see the attack you just added, make sure you\u0026rsquo;re lined up to the Exact time the Attack is at!    From here, press Enter on any of these options to change them:\n Starting time: When this attack starts. It\u0026rsquo;s better to remove/re-add an attack if you want to change when it starts. Seconds Remaining: How long the attack lasts (defalt: 5 seconds) Attack 1: The mod you just added - press enter to change Add Mod: Pick this to add another mod to this attack    Remove an Attack      In the editor, go to the beat the Attack is on and press Enter.\n  Pick the attack you want to remove and press Enter.\n  Pick the Mod you want to remove and press Enter.\n  When asked for a new Mod, backspace all the letters in the mod and press Enter.\n When all Mods in an attack are removed, the Attack is auto-removed.    Mod Strength/Approach Rate    Mod Strength    Is Beat too wild? Not wild enough? You can fix that!\n To change how strong a mod is, add a percentage before it, like 50% Beat\n By default, any mods you add default to 100%. You can dial this down if you don\u0026rsquo;t want a mod to be as strong.\nPercentages above 100% are a-ok if you want really strong mods! Negative percentages like -50% Beat work too if you want to totally invert an effect (it might not be obvious on all mods, but it does work).\nFinally: No means the same thing as 0%. Say, if you have a Beat attack earlier in the song, you can turn it off with 0% Beat or No Beat - either works!\nThe difference between 50% Beat and 100% Beat\n In the above video - Left = 40% Beat, Right = 125% Beat\n  Mod Approach Rate    Want a mod to slowly fade in over time, or instantly go to max strength? You can change that too!\n To change how fast/slow a mod is applied, add a * and a number before the mod, like *2 Beat\n Higher numbers apply mods faster, lower numbers (decimals included!) make mods apply slower.\n*0.5 = Half as fast, *2 = Twice as fast.\n(The default *1 applies at a rate of 100% of a mod over 1 second)\n Mod approach rate can also combine with any strength, including 0%! If you want to get rid of a mod really fast, you can use an attack like *50 0% Beat.\n The difference between *0.5 Beat and *10 Beat\n In the above video - Left = *0.5 Beat (fades in half as fast), Right = *10 Beat (fades in 10x as fast!). They both get to the same strength at the end, but the left side takes longer to do so.\n Resources/What\u0026rsquo;s Next    Next up is to play around with Modifiers! Experiment with what effects you can get, and discover what you do/don\u0026rsquo;t like!\n What Mods Can I Use?    Lots, actually!\n Check out the Guide to Mods in the sidebar for a list of mods you can use!\n  Mods Resources      FMS Cat\u0026rsquo;s Flip-Invert site helps give you combinations of various mods to move the note columns across the screen. Just drag the receptors where you want them on-screen!\n (You can alternatively use the MoveX/Y/Zn mods to move single note columns, like MoveX1, MoveX2, etc)    Check out WinDEU\u0026rsquo;s Marathon Tutorial series - it focuses on older versions of StepMania (where some mods, like Drunk and Tipsy, have different names), but a lot of the info still applies to SM5/Outfox. The later videos in the series dive really deep into how some mods behave!\n How to set up Mods in Courses in also covered in earlier videos in the series (though again, focusing on older versions of StepMania)    You can join Project Outfox\u0026rsquo;s Discord server for more help from the community - feel free to ask mods/attacks-related questions in channels like #mods-coding-help.\n   My Mods Don\u0026rsquo;t Work!     Double check you\u0026rsquo;ve spelled your Mod name right - mods from older versions of the game (like OpenITG) may have different names in SM5/Outfox! You may get strange behavior if you add new attacks into a simfile before the last attack in the file.   Mod Behaviors Across Different Themes    Some mods you add (like Drunk, Tornado, Boomerang) may change behavior depending on the theme you\u0026rsquo;re currently using.\nIn older versions (like Stepmania 5.0/5.1), the theme\u0026rsquo;s internal resolution (HD vs non-HD themes, specifically SCREEN_HEIGHT) is used in calculations for certain mods. On these versions, these mods will behave differently on themes with different internal resolutions.\nIn Outfox, these calculations are performed based on a completely separate theme metric instead, ModifierHeight. If the theme changes this value, it will affect those calculations (and therefore mod behaviors, and is noted as doing so).\nPlan accordingly if you plan on playing your simfiles/chart edits on different versions/themes!\n Other Notes     Mods obey stops and BPM changes in songs. If your song stops while a mod like Beat is in effect, the notes will freeze in the middle of Beat\u0026rsquo;s animation, skewed to the sides. Earlier versions of StepMania can round the time a mod starts at if you save and exit a simfile in the editor, making it harder/impossible to edit in the future. If this happens, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to manually edit the mod lines under the #ATTACKS tag in your simfile\u0026rsquo;s .sm/.ssc files.

The difficulty can range between \u0026ldquo;trivial to read\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;may as well memorize the chart\u0026rdquo;.\nOften called \u0026ldquo;Modfiles\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Modcharts\u0026rdquo;.\nThese usually use the FGCHANGES or BGCHANGES of a simfile to load the lua files (if any are used).\nDisclaimer: Make sure you\u0026rsquo;ve got making a chart down before starting to make modcharts! Good mods can\u0026rsquo;t save a bad chart!\nHow to Apply Modifiers    There are a few ways to go about this, and it varys depending on what version of SM is being used.\nApplyGameCommand (SM3.95/oITG/nITG)    ApplyGameCommand is a GameState function that provides a way to send modifiers among other commands. The first paramter is the command type followed by the parameters. (In this case, a modstring) The second parameter is what player to apply the command (1 = player 1). If not specified, it applies to all players.\nGAMESTATE:ApplyGameCommand(\u0026#34;mod, *0.5 420 beat\u0026#34;, 1) While it\u0026rsquo;s still available in SM5 (including OutFox), it\u0026rsquo;s not recommended because it applies mods to the \u0026ldquo;Preferred\u0026rdquo; ModsLevel, which means modifiers apply instantly (no transition), and they persist outside of the simfile. SM5.2 Doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have this function available.\n#MODS (Course files, SM3.95/oITG/nITG/SM5)    Old modfiles used to require going into marathon mode to play the scripted modifiers. Unlike most things, this is time-based due to charts being able to have stops.\n#MODS:TIME=0.000:END=10.000:MODS=*0.5 420 beat; #MODS:TIME=5.000:LEN=1.600:MODS=*2 50 stealth; (ex: Beat starts at 0 seconds and ends at 10. Stealth turns on at 5 seconds and ends 1.6 seconds later)\nNowadays, this is considered obsolete in favor of lua-powered modifiers. It\u0026rsquo;s still usuable in SM5.\n#ATTACKS (Simfiles, nITG/SM5)    Allows for the application of modifiers similar to what course files have. The syntax is exactly the same, just with MODS becoming ATTACKS.\n#ATTACKS:TIME=0.000:END=10.000:MODS=*0.5 420 beat; #ATTACKS:TIME=5.000:LEN=1.600:MODS=*2 50 stealth; nITG accepts #ATTACKS or #MODS inside the .sm file, while SM5 only accepts #ATTACKS in sm \u0026amp; ssc.\nThese do not load in course mode, however.\nApplyModifiers (nITG)    A dedicated function for applying modifiers without needing the processing overhead and \u0026ldquo;mod, \u0026quot; that ApplyGameCommand does.\nGAMESTATE:ApplyModifiers(\u0026#34;*0.5 420 beat\u0026#34;, 1) Often used as a replacement for ApplyGameCommand in nITG modfiles.\nPlayerOptions functions (SM5)    Every modifier has a setter function in PlayerOptions. This can be used in place of other functions. These are case-sensitive, though. If using strings, they\u0026rsquo;ll have to be parsed to make use of these functions.\nlocal po = {GAMESTATE:GetPlayerState(0):GetPlayerOptions(\u0026#39;ModsLevel_Song\u0026#39;), GAMESTATE:GetPlayerState(1):GetPlayerOptions(\u0026#39;ModsLevel_Song\u0026#39;)} po[1]:Beat(4.2, 0.5) SetPlayerOptions (SM5)    This function works by resetting the PlayerOptions for the given level, and setting it according to the string.\nGAMESTATE:GetPlayerState(PLAYER_1):SetPlayerOptions(\u0026#39;ModsLevel_Song\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;*0.5 420 beat\u0026#39;) Because it resets PlayerOptions, it might not be so useful for applying scripted modifiers.\nFromString (SM5.1 and onwards)    Like how ApplyModifiers is specifically for modstrings in nITG, FromString provides direct access to the string parser used for modifiers in ApplyGameCommand, and works very much like how ApplyGameCommand would.\nlocal po = {GAMESTATE:GetPlayerState(0):GetPlayerOptions(\u0026#39;ModsLevel_Song\u0026#39;), GAMESTATE:GetPlayerState(1):GetPlayerOptions(\u0026#39;ModsLevel_Song\u0026#39;)} po[1]:FromString(\u0026#34;*0.5 420 beat\u0026#34;) Modfile templates    Starting to make a modfile can seem really daunting if one does not know how to begin. Luckilly, there are many templates out there to help with creating modfiles.\nOnes made for Open/NotITG and SM3.95 are usually done with .xml files, and some rare .lua files.\nOnes made for SM5 are almost always .lua files.\nStepMania 5-Based templates      MTK\u0026rsquo;s OutFox port of Exschwasion\u0026rsquo;s easing template\n https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HfCFvTHZUI4dO_eAk4iN5mO3H61caHzE Lost of local variables used up in the main scope to preserve syntax.

You can think of them as images that represent each letter.\nWe have a BitmapText actor, with a default font (Common Normal) that has the following text:\nDef.BitmapText{ Font = \u0026#34;Common Normal\u0026#34;, Text = \u0026#34;This is my text\u0026#34;, InitCommand = function(self) -- Center the BitmapText actor. self:xy( SCREEN_CENTER_X, SCREEN_CENTER_Y ) end }   This actor becomes   We have a BitmapText actor, with a custom that has the following text:\nDef.BitmapText{ Font = \u0026#34;_eurostile normal\u0026#34;, Text = \u0026#34;This is my text\u0026#34;, InitCommand = function(self) -- Center the BitmapText actor. self:xy( SCREEN_CENTER_X, SCREEN_CENTER_Y ) end }   This actor becomes   To create these fonts, we have a tool called Texture Font Generator, which can create the font bitmaps. Keep in mind that this software currently is Windows only.\nThe Texture Font Generator\u0026rsquo;s more recent versions export glyphs that are only compatible with OutFox. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to use the tool to generate fonts for earlier StepMania releases, use the Legacy version of the tool.  Open the program and a window will pop up with a font preview and selections.\n The smaller window area provides info into what font to use, its size to render, and vertical spacing control buttons, these are tagged on the \u0026ldquo;Overlap\u0026rdquo; text area.\nMaximum size: indicates the size of each glyph.\nPadding: changes the vertical and horizontal spacing on each glyph.\nPage: is the glyph map to render out with the current font.\nIt is recommended to use a monospaced font for GUI elements, as it allows readability and accesibility for dyslexic individuals.    The tool allows for different kinds of options on what glyphs to export, which are the following:\n Exporting to only numbers, which are commonly used on scoring text (shown on screenshot above) Export strokes (a separate layer of fonts that can be used for bordering) Double Resolution (A flag added to the filename, which tells the engine to render the glyph half the size for sharper text, but it will need a bigger sized font for better results)  When you\u0026rsquo;re ready to export the font, click on File \u0026gt; Save, and a prompt window will appear asking the location on where to save the file. You can give the font a name, and this will be applied to all of the files exported. It\u0026rsquo;ll export the image itself containing the glyphs of the font, an Ini file containing the spacing data for each glyph and additional stroke images if the option to export strokes was enabled.\n"},{"id":107,"href":"/dev/mods/Mods-13-Miscellaneous-Mods/","title":"Miscellaneous Modifiers","parent":"Guide to Modifiers","content":"Miscellaneous Modifiers    These modifiers don\u0026rsquo;t really fit into any of the above categories, so they\u0026rsquo;re here instead.\n\u0026ldquo;clearall\u0026rdquo;    Desc: Tells PlayerOptions to do a reset.

In NotITG, this is known as \u0026ldquo;granulate\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;grain\u0026rdquo; (alias).\nNegative values make the hold smoother (with a \u0026lsquo;limit\u0026rsquo; of -93.75% which results in a step size of 1 pixel), but could cost performance due to the extra calculations being done. Positive values make the hold look more polygonal (with no real limit). Very noticable on modifiers that work on position, like Drunk.\nCommon values can range from practically anywhere due to it being a multiplier. Try starting with -50% or 100% and go further if extra points or less points are desired.\nQuirks: In NotITG, this modifier works a bit differently. At 0%, the holds are drawn with the normal stepsize, but the magnitude when nonzero controls the step size in pixels (100% = step size of 1 pixel, 400% = step size of 4 pixels (normal in NotITG)).

Does not affect holds. Comes in skewx \u0026amp; skewy variants, and is also column-specific. NotITG calls the skewx variant \u0026ldquo;noteskew\u0026rdquo; because they originally only had skewx.\nCommon values range from -200 to 200%\nQuirks: N/A\nAvailable variants: NoteSkewX, NoteSkewY\nColumn-specific variants: NoteSkewXCol, NoteSkewYCol\nAvailable variants (modstring): noteskewx, noteskewx\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, noteskew (NotITG name), noteskew\u0026lt;column\u0026gt; (NotITG name), noteskewy, noteskewy\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;\nPlayerOptions format: \u0026lt;NoteSkew variant\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;) Example: NoteSkewX(0.7, 4)\nColumn-specific format: \u0026lt;NoteSkewCol variant\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: NoteSkewXCol(1, 0.25, 0.25, true):NoteSkewXCol(2, 0.5, 0.5, true):NoteSkewXCol(3, 0.75, 0.75, true):NoteSkewXCol(4, 1, 1)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modstring variant\u0026gt;\nExample: *4 70% noteskewx *0.25 25% noteskewx1, *0.5 50% noteskewx2, *0.75 75% noteskewx3, *1 100% noteskewx4\nNoteSkewX video example\nAvailable sub modifiers:    noteskewtype (NotITG only)    Desc: When active, the note skews get rotated (but not the receptors).

Can act as an alternate way to enable zbuffer instead of using low amounts of z position modifiers. NotITG also allows having negative values to force it off. When the zbuffer is enabled, holds draw at a step size of 4 instead of 16. Also has \u0026ldquo;ztest\u0026rdquo; as an alias in NotITG.\nQuirks: N/A\nPlayerOptions format: ZBuffer(\u0026lt;enable\u0026gt;)\nExample: ZBuffer(true)\nModstring format: \u0026lt;enable\u0026gt; zbuffer\nExample: zbuffer\nCosecant    Desc: When active, all tangent modifiers use a cosecant wave instead of a tangent wave, mimicking how NotITG v1 did tangent wave modifiers.

Cannot be used to change noteskins mid-song (If forcing a noteskin, you have to reload the screen) like what OpenITG/SM3.95/NotITG has.\nPlayerOptions format: NoteSkin(\u0026lt;noteskin name\u0026gt;)\nExample: NoteSkin('Metal')\nModstring format: \u0026lt;noteskin name\u0026gt;\nExample: metal\nNoteSkinCol    Desc: Allow getting and setting the noteskin on a column-basis. Unlike NoteSkin, this allows for changing the noteskin mid-song.\nWhen used on a single column, the receptors will not change.\nWhen \u0026lt;column\u0026gt; is nil, all columns will use the requested noteskin, and the receptors will change to match.\nQuirks: Requires a Preferences.ini for the song that lists the noteskins to load. May not play nice when the noteskin isn\u0026rsquo;t loaded. NOTESKIN:DoesNoteSkinExist could be used to ensure the noteskin exists before setting. The change is instant unlike noteskin changes done through attacks in OpenITG/SM3.95/NotITG.\nPlayerOptions format: NoteSkinCol(\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;noteskin name\u0026gt;)\nExample: NoteSkinCol(nil, 'lambda')\nModstring format: \u0026lt;noteskin name\u0026gt; noteskin\u0026lt;column\u0026gt; (ommitting column will hit all columns)\nExample: lambda noteskin\nNoteSkinCol video example\nLifeSetting    Desc: Set the lifebar type to be used. There are three types (denoted as \u0026lt;type\u0026gt;):\n Bar (The normal lifebar most people are used to.) Modstring form is \u0026ldquo;bar\u0026rdquo;. Battery (Mess up a certain number of times and you fail the song) Modstring form is \u0026ldquo;battery\u0026rdquo;. Time (You have a limited amount of time to live. Hit notes better to gain time.) Modstring form is \u0026ldquo;lifetime\u0026rdquo;.  Quirks: This cannot be set during gameplay. It must be set before entering ScreenGameplay.\nPlayerOptions format: LifeSetting(\u0026lsquo;LifeType_\u0026lt;type\u0026gt;')\nExample: LifeSetting('LifeType_Time')\nModstring format: \u0026lt;type\u0026gt;\nExample: lifetime\nDrainSetting    Desc: Set how the lifebar\u0026rsquo;s health behavior works. There are three drain types (denoted as \u0026lt;type\u0026gt;):\n Normal (The health goes up and down at the expected rate.) Modstring form is \u0026ldquo;normal-drain\u0026rdquo;. NoRecover (The health only goes down.) Modstring form is \u0026ldquo;norecover\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;power-drop\u0026rdquo;. SuddenDeath (Getting any judgment below the required one will instantly kill you.) Modstring form is \u0026ldquo;suddendeath\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;death\u0026rdquo;.  Quirks: Initial health will start at 100% when not using Normal drain. Initial health for Normal is a theme metric, as well as the minimum judgment for SuddenDeath. This also works mid-gameplay, allowing for sections that require good accuracy.\nPlayerOptions format: DrainSetting(\u0026lsquo;DrainType_\u0026lt;type\u0026gt;')\nExample: DrainSetting('DrainType_NoRecover')\nModstring format: \u0026lt;type\u0026gt;\nExample: norecover\nBatteryLives    Desc: Set how many lives are available in the Battery life bar at the start.

Cannot be activated through modstrings.\nQuirks: N/A\nPlayerOptions format: NoAttack(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: NoAttack(1,1)\nPlayerAutoPlay    Desc: When active, AutoPlay will be set on the player. Cannot be set through modstrings.\nQuirks: Do not set this during gameplay. Attempting to enable it will result in no input for the player and no autoplay, which will result in a stage fail.\nPlayerOptions format: PlayerAutoPlay(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: PlayerAutoPlay(1, 1)\nPassmark    Desc: Set what life amount is required to pass a stage. Cannot be set through modstrings.\nQuirks: N/A\nPlayerOptions format: Passmark(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: Passmark(0.5, 2)\nMuteOnError    Desc: When active, keysounds will not play upon errors (letting go hold notes and/or missing).\nQuirks: N/A\nPlayerOptions format: MuteOnError(\u0026lt;enable\u0026gt;)\nExample: MuteOnError(true)\nModstring format: \u0026lt;enable\u0026gt; muteonerror\nExample: muteonerror\nFailSetting    Desc: Set how failing a song works.

ImmediateContinue (Song continues after failure, but you still fail at the end) Modstring forms are \u0026ldquo;failendofsong\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;failimmediatecontinue\u0026rdquo;. EndOfSong (Failure status is determined at the end of the song) Modstring form is \u0026ldquo;failatend\u0026rdquo;. Off (You cannot fail.) Modstring form is \u0026ldquo;failoff\u0026rdquo;.

These are always available to use, from anywhere in the theme. However, it is advised to use these sparingly to avoid unnecesary carry over of data, overlapping variable names with other existing Lua naming scopes, and others.\nIt is recommended practice to ensure script data is kept to a minimum to avoid collision with objects like song data, scores, player data, mods, profile information, song rates, and others.\nAn example of a script file can be the following:\nMyGlobalObject = {} -- Add some objets to this variable. MyGlobalObject.CustomFunction = function( val ) SCREENMAN:SystemMessage( \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;ve just recieved \u0026#34;.. val ) end Usage example:\nreturn Def.Actor{ OnCommand=function(self) -- Notice how this object is called, but there\u0026#39;s no presence of MyGlobalObject on this actor or even -- the file at all; given it\u0026#39;s loaded into memory.

MyGlobalObject = {} "},{"id":109,"href":"/dev/translation/","title":"Translation","parent":"Developers and Creators","content":"Are you translating a theme to another language? Reading this might help you.\nWhere are language files stored    Inside every theme there\u0026rsquo;ll be a Languages folder. Inside that folder is where language files are stored. Example:\nLanguages/ en.ini ja.ini Here we can see 2 language files: en for English and ja for Japanese. It\u0026rsquo;s a standard to name language files in that format (language-COUNTRY.ini). For example: In this case, there\u0026rsquo;s a Portuguese translation, but since there\u0026rsquo;s also Portuguese from Portugal, the file was named pt-BR (BR = Brazil).\nFallback    You probably already noticed a _fallback theme in the themes folder, but in case you didn\u0026rsquo;t: it\u0026rsquo;s where things that are necessary for every theme gets stored, so when someone is making a theme the game doesn\u0026rsquo;t blow up. The same goes for Languages: it\u0026rsquo;s important to also translate the fallback for your language because the theme you\u0026rsquo;re translating might not have every string that it uses on it\u0026rsquo;s own folder.\nStarting a translation    To start your work, create a new file for your language(-COUNTRY, if needed) and don\u0026rsquo;t forget to use the .ini extension. You can do this on Notepad with no problem but it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to use a editor like Visual Studio Code or Notepad++.\nNow open en.ini and your new language file, then copy all the content from en.ini to your language file. You can close en.ini now.\nWhat you should translate    This is an code example taken from Soundwaves theme.\n[Common] WindowTitle=Project OutFox StepMania=Project OutFox # Dedicated Character Display strings ModelLoadError=Model for %s (%s) Has a invalid model. Please check if the model.txt file is correctly named and formatted. ModelAnimLoadError=An animation file for %s\u0026#39;s model (%s) is invalid or non-existant. Please check the animation folders and see if there\u0026#39;s any file missing. LocationLoadError=Current Location (%s) is missing its location model. Please check if the model.txt file is correctly named and formatted. SongLoaderSingleSong=Random Song Play: Current Folder only contains 1 song. OutFox might get confused when picking the song via random. Selecting to index 1. SongLoaderNoSongs=Random Song Play: No songs were found in your OutFox install folder! Switching back to fallback music. You can see on this image and on your file that every line has a Title=Value, and that\u0026rsquo;s how translation works on OutFox, you need to translate the value of the titles and you\u0026rsquo;re done. The theme does all the work of what string it should use.\nNow, you can\u0026rsquo;t just translate literally everything that you see. On ModelLoadError for example there\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;%s\u0026rdquo; that means the theme or the game will put a string replacing that %s.\nAn example of that can be seen on the string %d Song Played that you\u0026rsquo;ll see on the next image.\n[Screen] HelpText=\u0026amp;BACK; Exit \u0026amp;START; Select \u0026amp;SELECT; Options \u0026amp;MENULEFT;\u0026amp;MENURIGHT;\u0026amp;MENUUP;\u0026amp;MENUDOWN; Move [ScreenWithMenuElements] HelpText=\u0026amp;BACK; Exit \u0026amp;START; Select \u0026amp;MENULEFT;\u0026amp;MENURIGHT; Move StageCounter=%s Stage EventStageCounter=Song %i You\u0026rsquo;ll also see lines like \u0026amp;START;, \u0026amp;SELECT; etc. They\u0026rsquo;re buttons that will be replaced once the game draws that string. Let\u0026rsquo;s see one of those strings in action?\n[ScreenSelectProfile] SingularSongPlayed=%d Song Played SeveralSongsPlayed=%d Songs Played PressStart=Press \u0026amp;START; to join. Here we can see that \u0026amp;START; gets replaced by a green square that represents the start button, and %d gets replace by a number that\u0026rsquo;s how many songs that profile played.\nAnother special string is \\n. It creates a line break. For example, First Line\\nSecondLine would result in:\nFirst Line\nSecond Line\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a example in action from _fallback/en.ini:\nText Context    You might also want to translate the theme in a way that someone who has never played before will understand it, instead of expecting everyone to already know what everything is. A new player might not understand what \u0026ldquo;holds\u0026rdquo; mean if that word is translated to your language, but if it was kept as \u0026ldquo;holds\u0026rdquo; the user would know that it\u0026rsquo;s the literal name of the thing and not something that should make sense in your language.\nAnother hard example are steps: in OutFox, there are 2 kinds of steps. The ones that you press in gameplay and the steps of the chart made by the author (easy steps, hard steps\u0026hellip;). In English, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to only say steps because it makes sense for both, but that isn\u0026rsquo;t the case with every language. That\u0026rsquo;s why it was decided to keep it named \u0026ldquo;steps\u0026rdquo; for the pt-BR translation of Soundwaves, for example.\nCommunity Translations for Soundwaves (OutFox default until Alpha V)    Many folks are already helping translate the new Soundwaves theme for various languages. As requested by one of our translators, we\u0026rsquo;ll mention those projects below in order to give them some visibility and encourage more people to join and help.\n° Polish - Done by Moneko\n° Japanese - Done by はぬべき(hanubeki)\n° Portuguese-Brazilian - Done by zerinho6, SHRMP0 and SheepyChris\n° German - Done by DanielRotwind\n° Hebrew - Done by Snil4\n° French - Done by Ksempac and Kaede573\n° Español - Done by JoseVarelaP\n° Hungarian - Done by KaZo75\n° Italian - Done by Gabrimax\n Tools and Practices    Translating can be boring and tedious. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s hard to locate \u0026amp; remove lines that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be there or find missing ones. Because of that, translators themselves create tools to make our job easier and faster.\nTranslation Toolkit  Translation Toolkit is a tool made by Ksempac to help remove lines that are not needed anymore, warn about lines that are missing, check your progress, etc. It supports linux, Mac and Windows.\n This project is intended as a small application to automate some tasks for translators.\nIt is able to parse, analyze and fix the OutFox translation files.   Stepmania-TranslatorViewMaker  Stepmania-TranslatorViewMaker is a tool made by Snil4. It supports any OS that has python 3 installed.\n Have you ever tried to translate a program like OutFox and wondered \u0026ldquo;Hmm, now where can I find that line in the .ini?\u0026rdquo; Now there\u0026rsquo;s no need to wonder! This program will make a translator view file for your translation .ini and make you translation job easier.\n  Tiny-Webini  Tiny-Webini is a tool made by zerinho6 to help with translations of OutFox Website. While not used to translate OutFox (unless themes adopt HTML in the future), it uses the same translation system as OutFox. It makes less HTML code or none at all being necessary to translate the website. While the souce code might be able to run on other OS by building manually, it only supports Windows officially.\n Translate OutFox website with the same style OutFox uses for its translations.\n   Best practices    Be constant with your words    When doing a mention to \u0026ldquo;Steps\u0026rdquo;, ask yourself: is it clear which \u0026ldquo;type of Steps\u0026rdquo; you\u0026rsquo;re referring to? We have the following \u0026ldquo;types of steps\u0026rdquo;:\n Steps, which means the notes inside of the chart or the note count. StepDifficulty, which means the difficulty selected of the chart, such as Novice, Expert, Hard. Step, which means the action of stepping in the pad or a single note. StepType, which means the quantization (timing/color) of the note (e.g. 4th = red, an entire beat; 8th = blue, half a beat; etc).  Soundwaves does not have this issue as it says \u0026ldquo;Taps\u0026rdquo; instead of Steps and directly says the difficulty.\nReload translations    Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re editing the Soundwaves ScreenCaution and want to see how the translated string looks. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to restart the entire game to see the changes, here\u0026rsquo;s what you should do instead: Exit the screen you just translated, reload the metrics (Shift + Insert; or Shift + F2 on older alpha versions) and enter the screen again.\nSome themes might have a problem where not all strings are updated when metrics are reloaded due to how they are made. In that case, unfortunately the only option is restart the game.\n OutFox Releases    Now that you have translated the latest alpha, you need to send it to OutFox somehow. This tutorial explains how you can do it!\nThe first thing to keep in mind is that each OutFox translation is hosted inside Tiny-Foxes to easily maintain and keep track of updates, so contact Team Rizu through any of their available social media profiles to get invited into Tiny-Foxes.\nIt is also required to know how git and Github works.\nExact steps are:\n Create a Github account Download and learn basic git commands such as (git status, git push, git pull, git commit and git checkout) Learn how github organization works.  Having an editor such as Visual Studio Code will make git interactions way easier as those commands are available by the interface.\nRepository    OutFox translation repositories adhere to a standard style. Repository title should be:\n\u0026ldquo;OutFox-[languageFileName[-COUNTRY]]\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026quot;-COUNTRY\u0026quot; should only be added in special cases (example: there\u0026rsquo;s Portuguese from Portugal and Brazilian Portuguese, so the Portuguese-Brazilian language file is \u0026ldquo;pt-BR.ini\u0026rdquo;).\nThe description of the repository should be:\n\u0026ldquo;[Language Name] ([languageFileName]) Translation for Project OutFox\u0026rdquo;\u0026quot;\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example:\nOutFox-ja Japanese (ja) Translation for Project OutFox Repository Format    The repository should have 2 folders: \u0026ldquo;_fallback\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo;. Inside the _fallback will be the _fallback translation and default translation inside the default folder.\nOnly the translation file is required to be inside the folders/repository.\nKeep track    It\u0026rsquo;s recommended that you include the version that the translation is targeting inside the files. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n# Version: 4.9.7 Alpha [Common] WindowTitle=Project OutFox StepMania=OutFox Submitting to OutFox    So you finished the translation for this alpha before the release? You can then commit directly to master OR make a Pull Request with your files to OutFox-Translations so Jose_Varela includes them in the next alpha release.\nThis all assumes that you\u0026rsquo;re already a member of Tiny-Foxes and the translator team.\nWebmasters Project    Webmasters is an internal OutFox initiative to translate OutFox Website. Being a webmaster means:\n Partial access to the website backend to implement your translation files; Closer contact with the OutFox Commmunity team for quick updates and help; Having a special role in our Discord Server.  The requirements to join Webmasters are having previous experience as a long-term OutFox translator, being a Discord Server member, and receiving a special invitation from the OutFox Team.\nIf you meet those requirements, there are already tools to help you:\n  OutFoxWeb\n Constantly updated to represent elements that are possible to be translated in the website. Translating those files would result in translating 80% what is possible to translate in the website already.    Tiny-Webini\n A tool created by zerinho6 to make website translation faster, easier, better and more like OutFox. Tiny-Webini removes all need to editing HTML files and uses a single .ini file like OutFox instead, it also has translator tools such as: show what can be translated by highlighting translatable elements, changing all translatable text to show its string key instead of string value and generate the HTML files needed to apply on the website backend.

Storing it into a local variable that gets returned will waste resources.\nThere are two ways to add onto an actorframe.\nMethod 1 (indexing):\nlocal t = Def.ActorFrame{ Def.Sprite{ --commands \u0026amp; stuff }, Def.BitmapText{ --who even knows }, } t[#t+1] = Def.Actor{ --It\u0026#39;s the third actor } return t Method 2 (lua concatenation):\nreturn Def.ActorFrame{ Def.Sprite{ --commands \u0026amp; stuff }, Def.BitmapText{ --who even knows }, } ..

If you are on a multi-user operating system, content in these folders will be accessible to all users. When Portable Mode is enabled, your save data (including profiles and preference files) will be placed in the installation directory. User folders are also created in your operating system\u0026rsquo;s home/user directory if Portable Mode is disabled. When Portable Mode is disabled, this is where your save data will be stored.  On macOS, these folders are located in ~/Library/Preferences/StepMania 5.3/ On Linux, these folders are located in ~/.stepmania-5.3/ On Windows, these folders are located in %APPDATA%\\StepMania 5.3   Additional folders are paths configured in the Preferences.ini file; for instance, you can store your song library on a second hard drive and link to it there, or share content between multiple installations.  These content folders comprise the game\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Virtual File System\u0026rdquo; (VFS). They are, in turn, divided into various subdirectories for storing specific types of content.\nAnnouncers    Announcers are a collection of audio files that play automatically based on specific triggers, such as in-game events or navigating to specific screens.\nAppearance    Avatars    Square images that can be used as avatars for your profile.\nJudgments    If supported by the current theme, you can pick a different design for in-game judgement displays from images in this folder.\nJudgement fonts are divided into equally-sized sprites for each judgement. Fonts designed for specific timing modes have a modifier in their file name, such as [Advanced], [FAPlus], etc. A judgement font can also have specific versions for early and late timings.\nNoteSkins    NoteSkins affect the appearance of notes. They could be arrows, bars, circles, pawprints, etc. Project OutFox is compatible with noteskins designed for StepMania 5.\nThe NoteSkins folder is divided into subfolders for specific game types. A global noteskin appears in all game types.\nNoteSkins │ └───dance │ │ │ └───metal │ │NoteSkin.lua │ │... Themes    Themes determine the look, feel, and functionality of the game.

Delete this folder to force the game to reload all songs.\nCharacters    3D character models that can be displayed in-game.\nCourses    Playlists of songs used in course modes (such as Extended).\nLogs    When Project OutFox is running, it generates various log files to record diagnostic information and errors. If you are having issues with the game, the log file is a good place to begin.\nRandomMovies    Video clips that can be played in the background in-game. They can also be used as part of background script sequences in songs.\nSave    This is where data such as preferences, profiles, high scores, etc. are stored.
