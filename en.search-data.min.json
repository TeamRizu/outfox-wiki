[{"id":0,"href":"/dev/mods/Mods-0-Overview/","title":"Overview of modifiers","parent":"Guide to Modifiers","content":"Modifiers    Modifiers often change or affect some aspect of the gameplay, usually by messing with the game\u0026rsquo;s notefield. Some modifiers can be selected through the options menu before starting a song, but there are also simfiles with scripted modifiers that tend to have a wildly different experience than just a regular simfile. (Generally, they\u0026rsquo;re known as \u0026ldquo;modfiles\u0026rdquo;)\nGeneral notes    Often, modifiers (or \u0026ldquo;mods\u0026rdquo;) have what\u0026rsquo;s called an \u0026ldquo;approach rate\u0026rdquo;, which is how fast it\u0026rsquo;ll go to reach the specified value. When not specified, an approach rate of 1 is used, which means 100% per second.\nSo, if you have a modifier that goes from 0 to 200%, it will take 2 seconds, while 200% to -150% would take 3.5 seconds. The approach rate can be a floating point number, so values like 0.24523 or 3.7 are valid.\nApproach rates cannot be negative in SM5.3 alpha 4.8.2 or earlier, or it will crash.\nIn \u0026ldquo;NotITG\u0026rdquo; \u0026amp; SM5.3 alpha 4.8.3 and later, negative approach rates (specifically -1 in NotITG, but in general on SM5) are used to signify \u0026ldquo;instant\u0026rdquo; rates. in older versions of SM5, you can use large approach rate numbers (such as 10000 or 9e9) to achieve this.\nMagnitude is usually shown in the form of percentages for modifiers, and are capable of being negative, unless otherwise noted.\nThere are also column-specific modifiers. This affect a single column instead of the whole notefield. In NotITG, column numbering starts at 0, while it starts at 1 in SM5.\nFor the column-specific lua functions (except for gradients, mentioned later), nil can be given as the column to affect all columns of a player. (Does not work in alpha 4.8.2 of SM5.3 or earlier)\nModstrings    Normally these modifiers will have a modstring form that follows this general format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;percentage\u0026gt;% \u0026lt;mod name\u0026gt; but some modifiers, like speed mods, may not follow that format.\nWhen not given a percentage, 100% is assumed. no is another way to say 0% as well.\neg: *2 bumpy is the same as *2 100% bumpy.\nThe % is optional and modstrings can work without it, but it\u0026rsquo;s there for visual convenience.\neg: *2 200 bumpy is the same as *2 200% bumpy.\nThe mod name is case insensitive.\nThese modstrings can be used either by simfile ATTACKS, course MODS, or through PlayerOptions' FromString function. Smaller numbers like 0.5 require the preceding 0.\nAny modifier or sub modifier that is boolean has a turning point of 50%. Giving 50% or more will turn it on, while 49% or lower will turn it off.\nPlayerOptions Functions    Going from modstrings to PlayerOptions functions, the magnitude has to be divided by 100 most of the time, and mod names are now case sensitive.\nWhen calling a PlayerOptions function, they often have an optional final boolean parameter that can be placed after all of the parameters that allows for function chaining similar to what Actor does, allowing for something like this:\nXMod(2.5, 3, true):Drunk(-0.75, 2.7)\nWhen passed nothing in the parameters, the function returns two values: the current magnitude, the current approach rate. However, when passed in parameters, the previous values for magnitude and rate are returned.\nYou can grab a player\u0026rsquo;s PlayerOptions for scripting purposes by doing the following: local po = {GAMESTATE:GetPlayerState('PlayerNumber_P1'):GetPlayerOptions('ModsLevel_Song'),GAMESTATE:GetPlayerState('PlayerNumber_P2'):GetPlayerOptions('ModsLevel_Song')}\nThis stores them into a table for easy access at any point during the song. po[1] is what you\u0026rsquo;d use to affect Player 1, while po[2] affects Player 2. Both will need to be used to affect both players with the same mods.\nSimfile ATTACKS and course MODS will override \u0026amp; reset anything set through lua on the Song level, and cannot be player-specific.\nVideo Examples    The video examples for the modifiers use an excerpt of GPOP\u0026rsquo;s expert chart for \u0026ldquo;My Story\u0026rdquo; from the \u0026ldquo;G.P.O.P.S. 3\u0026rdquo; pack.\nThe speed mod used is 1.5x, and the noteskin usually is the default noteskin for dance mode, with Exact3D used when needed.\nThe magnitude used in the video examples also may not be the value used in the textual example.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/dev/mods/Mods-1-Speed-Mods/","title":"Speed","parent":"Guide to Modifiers","content":"These modifiers are used to control the scroll speed of notes in gameplay. These modifiers are not column-specific, unlike later mods described elsewhere.\nNegative speed modifiers cannot be selected from the Player Options menu, nor can it be set through the lua functions PlayerOptions provides, but it can become negative through the use of mod strings (and some modfiles have taken advantage of that).\nXMod    Desc: The \u0026ldquo;X\u0026rdquo; in \u0026ldquo;XMod\u0026rdquo; is for multiply, with it often showing as 1x or 2.5x or some other multiplier value followed by an x. Larger multiplier numbers result in a faster scroll. This speed mod type is capable of showing BPM changes, stops and other chart segment types. Often ranges of 1 to 4 (and in between at practically any specified granularity) can be common.\nQuirks: When setting this through the lua function it will immediately override CMod, MMod or AMod unlike how it functions in courses or modstring-based modfiles.\nPlayerOptions format: XMod(\u0026lt;multiplier\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: XMod(2.5, 0.5)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;multiplier\u0026gt;x\nExample: *0.5 2.5x\nCMod    Desc: The \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo; in \u0026ldquo;CMod\u0026rdquo; is for \u0026ldquo;Constant BPM Scroll\u0026rdquo;, with it often showing as C200 or C450.5 or some other BPM value preceded by a C. Larger BPM values result in faster scroll speeds. This speed mod type visibly ignores chart segments and only shows a constant speed. (some forks of SM even disqualify if the chart has BPM changes and CMod is used!) Other modifiers still work on CMod, though.\nOften ranges of 200 to 400 (and in between at practically any specified granularity) can be common, but some people may be more comfortable reading at slower or faster speeds.\nQuirks: When setting this through the lua function it will immediately override XMod, MMod or AMod unlike how it functions in courses or modstring-based modfiles.\nPlayerOptions format: CMod(\u0026lt;BPM Value\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: CMod(200, 0.5)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; c\u0026lt;BPM value\u0026gt;\nExample: *0.5 c200\nMMod    Desc: The \u0026ldquo;M\u0026rdquo; in \u0026ldquo;MMod\u0026rdquo; is for \u0026ldquo;Maximum BPM Scroll\u0026rdquo;, with it often showing as m200 or m450.5 or some other BPM value preceded by an m. Unlike CMod, this speed modifier supports everything that XMod does. Instead of specifying a BPM speed for the whole song, this specifies the maximum scroll speed that will be used.\nOften ranges of 200 to 400 (and in between at practically any specified granularity) can be common, but some people may be more comfortable reading at slower or faster speeds.\nQuirks: The magnitude is in the hundreds most of the time, so a larger approach rate might be needed.\nPlayerOptions format: MMod(\u0026lt;BPM Value\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: MMod(200, 0.5)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; m\u0026lt;BPM value\u0026gt;\nExample: *0.5 m200\nAMod    Desc: The \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; in \u0026ldquo;AMod\u0026rdquo; is for \u0026ldquo;Average BPM Scroll\u0026rdquo;, with it often showing as a200 or a450.5 or some other BPM value preceded by an a. Like MMod, this modifier supports everything XMod supports, and the song\u0026rsquo;s BPM is used in calculations, the average of the song\u0026rsquo;s BPMs is calculated instead of the maximum BPM being used. (and the amount of time a BPM lasts for is taken into account, too)\nOften ranges of 200 to 400 (and in between at practically any specified granularity) can be common, but some people may be more comfortable reading at slower or faster speeds.\nQuirks: The magnitude is in the hundreds most of the time, so a larger approach rate might be needed.\nPlayerOptions format: AMod(\u0026lt;BPM Value\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: AMod(200, 0.5)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; a\u0026lt;BPM value\u0026gt;\nExample: *0.5 a200\nRandomSpeed    Desc: Each note is given a random addition to its' speed mod, with larger additions being applied when a higher magnitude is used. This does not have column-specific controls.\nNormally, 100 is the magnitude used (as it\u0026rsquo;s not commonly used in modfiles), but other values are valid.\nQuirks: Only values greater than zero have any visual effect. Missed notes revert to the actual speed mod upon passing the receptors.\nPlayerOptions format: RandomSpeed(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: RandomSpeed(1, 0.125)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; randomspeed\nExample: *0.125 100% randomspeed\nSpeed Modifier Controllers    These modifiers control the internal parts of the speed modifiers above, and usually shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be used unless there\u0026rsquo;s a good reason to. Like the speed mods above, these aren\u0026rsquo;t column-specific either, but can support negative numbers like how the modstrings do. Unlike the speed modifiers listed above, there is no modstring form for any of these.\nTimeSpacing    Desc: Allows one to switch between CMod and the remaining mods. At 100%, this tells the game to use CMods. 0% means use XMod/MMod/AMod.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s tweenable like other modifiers, which allows one to tween \u0026lsquo;between\u0026rsquo; CMods and the other mods.\nOften the values used only range between 0 and 100%\nQuirks: The \u0026lsquo;tweening\u0026rsquo; capability can cause interesting stutter effects while tweening. Some modfiles take advantage of this. This cannot be replicated with the plain CMod \u0026amp; XMod PlayerOptions functions, but can be replicated with modstrings.\nPlayerOptions format: TimeSpacing(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: TimeSpacing(1)\nScrollBPM (Used for CMod, values are BPMs)    Desc: This is the underlying BPM value that CMod uses. Common values are the same as those for CMod.\nQuirks: Like the BPM-based speed mods, the magnitude is often in the 100s, so a larger approach rate might be needed.\nPlayerOptions format: ScrollBPM(\u0026lt;BPM value\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: ScrollBPM(1, 2)\nAvarageScrollBPM    Desc: This is the underlying BPM value that AMod uses. When this is zero, AMod is turned off. Common values are the same as those for AMod.\nQuirks: Like the BPM-based speed mods, the magnitude is often in the 100s, so a larger approach rate might be needed.\nPlayerOptions format: AvarageScrollBPM(\u0026lt;BPM value\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: AvarageScrollBPM(200, 0.5)\nMaxScrollBPM    Desc: This is the underlying BPM value that MMod uses. When this is zero, MMod is turned off, and AMod is able to be used. Common values are the same as those for MMod.\nQuirks: Like the BPM-based speed mods, the magnitude is often in the 100s, so a larger approach rate might be needed.\nPlayerOptions format: MaxScrollBPM(\u0026lt;BPM value\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: MaxScrollBPM(200, 0.5)\nScrollSpeed    Desc: This is the underlying multiplier value that XMod uses. Common values are the same as those for XMod.\nQuirks: N/A\nPlayerOptions format: ScrollSpeed(\u0026lt;multiplier\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: ScrollSpeed(2.5, 0.5)\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/dev/mods/Mods-2-Perspective-Mods/","title":"Perspective","parent":"Guide to Modifiers","content":"Perspective modifiers tilt and skew the notefield itself to allow for a feeling of depth. Scripted modfiles can use these to do effects like rocking the notefield back and forth among other effects (And is definitely noticable with 3D noteskins).\nUnlike most modifiers available through PlayerOptions, these functions only return values in terms of tilt and skew and don\u0026rsquo;t return the current/previous approach rate.

Going to 100% on column 1 will also make the judgment \u0026amp; combo swap positions.\nFor example, 100% reverse + 100% reverse on a single column would result in that single column having upscroll and the rest being downscroll.\nAvailable Variants (modstring): reverse, reverse\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;\nPlayerOptions format: Reverse(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: Reverse(1, 2)\nColumn-specific format: ReverseCol(\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: ReverseCol(2, 0.25, 0.25)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modstring variant\u0026gt;\nexample: *2 100% reverse *0.25 25% reverse2\nReverse video example\nAvailable sub modifiers:    UnboundedReverse    Desc: UnboundedReverse is a boolean modifier that makes it so Reverse no longer bounces back when going over 100% (Acts similar to negative reverse, behavior-wise).

Commonly used to create \u0026ldquo;driven drops\u0026rdquo;. Can also be activated with converge in modstring form.\nAlso often combined with other scroll modifiers above.\nCommonly used at 100%, but more or less can be used. Negative values move the notefield up.\nQuirks: The speed it has when going to the center depends on multiple theme metrics, so \u0026ldquo;driven drop\u0026rdquo; effects may be inconsistent across multiple themes. Most modfiles expect ITG positioning, which is available as the \u0026ldquo;Lower\u0026rdquo; note position setting in the default theme. The player\u0026rsquo;s Combo also moves down based on the current amount of Centered.\nPlayerOptions format: Centered(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: Centered(1. 0.5)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; centered\nexample: *0.5 100% centered\nCentered video example\nCenteredPath    Desc: While Centered moves the notefield down in position, CenteredPath moves the columns down their current path in multiples of the column\u0026rsquo;s width (Commonly 64 pixels for dance mode). This consist amount allows for more consistent \u0026ldquo;driven drops\u0026rdquo; across different setups. In NotITG, this modifier is called centered2.\nLarge amounts of CenteredPath may be used because \u0026ldquo;driven drops\u0026rdquo; can span the whole screen height.\nWhen combined with the opposite amount of MoveY in upscroll, interesting movement effects can be achieved.\nQuirks: Because CenteredPath moves columns down the path, receptors may become affected by mods that otherwise would not affect them (As seen in the video example with Tornado), and note paths may look different.\nPlayerOptions format: CenteredPath(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: CenteredPath(2.5,0.23)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; centeredpath\nexample: *0.23 250% centeredpath\nCenteredPath video example\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;Driven Drop\u0026rdquo;?    Driven Drops are an effect where the notes are stationary while the receptor moves down to hit the notes. (As seen in the ITG course, \u0026ldquo;Driven\u0026rdquo;)\nOften, speed mod has to be taken into account for these (which can be made simpler by forcing a speed mod).\nCenteredPath makes it easier due to using a consistent amount that doesn\u0026rsquo;t depend on multiple theme metrics, but the resulting effect may look different.\n\u0026ldquo;SCAR\u0026rdquo; Gimmicks    Before column-specific Reverse existed, Combinations of Split, Cross, Alternate and Reverse (SCAR, for short) were used to generate column-specific reverse in 4 panel modes.

When activating, notes start glowing white (0 to 50%), and then the glow fades away to an invisible note (50 to 100%). There\u0026rsquo;s a column-specific version. All variants add onto eachother, so it\u0026rsquo;s possible to have one variant at 100%, and undo it for another type with a different variant at -100%.\nBecause of this additive property, the range often used can go between -100 and 100%.\nStealthMines affects the mines only, while StealthHolds only affects the hold bodies (topcap, body, bottomcap)\nNotITG has column-specific versions of those variants, too.\nQuirks: N/A\nAvailable variants: Stealth, StealthCol, StealthHolds, StealthMines\nAvailable variants (modstring): stealth, stealth\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, stealthmines, minestealth (NotITG\u0026rsquo;s name for stealthmines), minestealth\u0026lt;column\u0026gt; (NotITG only), hidemines (NotITG alias), hidemines\u0026lt;column\u0026gt; (NotITG alias), stealthholds, holdstealth (NotITG\u0026rsquo;s name for stealthholds), holdstealth\u0026lt;columns\u0026gt; (NotITG\u0026rsquo;s only), hideholds (NotITG alias), hideholds\u0026lt;column\u0026gt; (NotITG alias)\nPlayerOptions format: \u0026lt;Stealth variant\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: Stealth(0.90, 1, true):StealthMines(-0.4, 1)\nColumn-specific format: StealthCol(\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: StealthCol(1, 0.25, 1, true):StealthCol(2, 0.5, 1, true):StealthCol(3, 0.75, 1, true):StealthCol(4, 0.90, 1, true)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modstring variant\u0026gt;\nExample: *1 90% stealth, *1 -40% stealthmines *1 25% stealth1, *1 50% stealth2, *1 75% stealth3, *1 90% stealth4\nStealth video example\nAvailable sub modifiers:    StealthType    Desc: When active, Stealth, Sudden, Hidden, Blink and RandomVanish act based on y offset (distance from the receptor) instead of the visible y position on the screen.\nPlayerOptions format: StealthType(\u0026lt;enable\u0026gt;)\nModstring format: \u0026lt;enable\u0026gt; stealthtype\nStealthPastReceptors    Desc: When active, Stealth, Sudden, Hidden, Blink and RandomVanish will not revert to zero upon passing the receptors.\nPlayerOptions format: StealthPastReceptors(\u0026lt;enable\u0026gt;)\nModstring format: \u0026lt;enable\u0026gt; stealthpastreceptors\nSudden    Desc: Notes start invisible and appear at around the middle of the notefield.\nDue to how Stealth works, values between -100 and 100% usually get used.\nQuirks: When combined with Hidden, the appearance point moves down.\nPlayerOptions format: Sudden(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: Sudden(1, 1)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; sudden\nExample: *1 100% sudden\nSudden video example\nAvailable sub modifiers:    SuddenOffset    Desc: Shifts the point where the notes appear.

The blinking itself is based on game uptime.\nUnlike most modifiers, this only has an on and off state. Any positive magnitude will work.\nQuirks: Due to the magnitude not affecting anything and the clock being based on game uptime (unless ModTimer is changed), Blink is considered a bad mod in terms of scripted modfiles, and its' use is discouraged.\nPlayerOptions format: Blink(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: Blink(1, 1)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; blink\nExample: *1 100% blink\nBlink video example\nRandomVanish    Desc: The notes disappear, then reappear in a different/random column.

It is led by Team Rizu, a development team led by community veteran Squirrel, as well as many other prominent members of the current community.\nWhat is different?    We have been focusing on refactoring the internal codebase to improve performance, adhere to modern coding practices, and enhance its capabilities on modern hardware and other platforms (including single-board embedded systems such as Raspberry Pi). Improvements to uncapped frame rate have also been recorded on older hardware, as far back as the Pentium E2180. It also incorporates a new default theme with more integrated features than previous versions, and new internal functions that can be used for future content.\nWe are also working to flesh out its support for other gameplay styles beyond just dance games, true to our belief that this is a rhythm game engine and not simply a simulator/emulator for popular dance game franchises.\nAs Project OutFox is a continuation of the 5.0.12 and 5.1 codebase (not “5.2”), it remains compatible with almost all existing songs, themes, and noteskins that are supported on these versions (if you do encounter odd behaviour or other issues with older content, please report it to us as a bug).\n5.3 is unrelated to 5.1 -3 (sometimes written as 5.1-3), which was a prior build of 5.2 before it was renamed.\nProject OutFox Teams       Development Design Community     Squirrel Jose Varela Moru Zerinho6   Jousway Lirodon SHRMP0   Cube SheepyChris Moneko   MrThatKid — Hanubeki   ArcticFqx — Gabrimax98   Jose Varela — Sudospective   — — RodentVienna    The development members are the ones that make OutFox possible.

Game types are further divided into styles, which define chart types such as single, double, etc.\nAs of 5.3.0-alpha-4.9.8, they include:\n dance - The default game type. Similar to games such as Dance Dance Revolution and In the Groove, it uses four lanes in the cardinal directions (left, down, up, right). It also contains a 6-lane style (solo) adding up-left and up-right directions, and a 3-lane style using only up-left, down, and up-right. pump - A five-lane dance game, which uses four diagional directions and the center rather than cardinal directions. In terms of functionality and behavior it is in line with Pro/StepMania 4 CVS. kb7 - A seven-lane game type designed primarily for keyboard play, with two sets of three keys flanking a centre column (usually mapped by default to the SDF, JKL, and space keys). This is a StepMania-specific game type that does not emulate any specific game. ez2 - A game type based on the defunct arcade dance game EZ2Dancer, which uses three foot panels and a pair of hand sensors. para - A dance game designed for para para routines, which is typically played with five infrared hand sensors in a semicircular layout, and uses a considerably looser scoring system. It is modelled upon the mechanics of the defunct arcade dance game Para Para Paradise. ds3ddx - A dance game whose format is common among Chinese arcade dance games, which uses four diagional foot panels, and four hand sensors around the pad in the cardinal directions. beat - Supports 5-key and 7-key styles, and the ability to load BMS files. Full BME/BML support is coming soon. maniax - A game type based on the defunct arcade dance game Dance Maniax, which uses four hand sensors arranged into two columns (upper and lower). techno - A dance game type designed for pads with nine panels, including 4-lane (similar to dance), 5-lane (similar to pump), 8-lane (using all but the center panel), and 9-lane styles in single and double versions. popn - A PMS player mode, supporting 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9-button styles, and the ability to load PMS files. gddm - A drum mode supporting six-part (five drums and one pedal) and nine-part (seven drums, bass pedal, hi-hat pedal) styles, modelled upon the mechanics of the arcade rhythm game DrumMania. 5 and 10-part with full DTX file support coming soon. gdgf (formerly guitar prior to 5.3.0-alpha-4.9.8) - A guitar mode supporting three-fret and five-fret styles, modelled upon the mechanics of the arcade rhythm game Guitar Freaks. gh - A five-fret guitar mode modelled upon the mechanics of once-popular console games originating from North America. kickbox - Obscure lash-a-soft dance pad-to-a-punching-bag mode (four, six, and eight-sensor modes).  Future game types    These are proposed and are scheduled on the roadmap. Limitations or code problems may delay or change these modes, so there is no date or ETA given.\n drum - A MIDI-based drum mode with 20 parts simulating a full Yamaha DTX drum kit. karaoke - A (\u0026hellip;do i need to explain this?) singing mode. Will happen if Squirrel gets off his butt. jam - A mode properly supporting o2Jam and its modes, with full .OJM loader support. piu - A major refactoring to make it more accurate to the mainline series. taitai - A \u0026ldquo;don da don\u0026rdquo; styled mode, supporting .TJA files.

It should run on just about any computer from the mid-2000s onward, depending on the operating system and hardware specifications. We have had alphas running on CPUs as old as the Pentium E2180.\nThe Windows build of Project OutFox requires Windows 7 or later. Windows XP builds are available for selected releases, which require Service Pack 3.\nParts of the game are so well-optimised now that they\u0026rsquo;re running too fast, and the rest of the game needs to catch up. We will have a proper fix later, but increasing the amount of background activity (i.e. having other programs running in the background, etc.) is a temporary solution.\nHow to install Project OutFox    Download the installer or package for your respective operating system on the Project OutFox website.\nWindows    Windows builds of Project OutFox use an installer; follow the instructions, and launch the game using the provided shortcuts.\n It is recommended that you do not install it to the Program Files directory, as this is known to cause problems. The installer offers optional components, such as the noteskins that were included with StepMania 5.0.12 and 5.1, and \u0026ldquo;Toasties\u0026rdquo; - animations that can trigger on combo milestones in-game. By default, the game is installed in \u0026ldquo;Portable Mode\u0026rdquo;; save data is stored in the installation directory. If you disable portable mode, your save data will be stored in your user directory under %APPDATA%/StepMania 5.3.  If your log file (Installation directory/Logs) shows WDDM1.0 or WDDM1.1 at the end of the graphics card name (i.e. \u0026ldquo;Intel(R) 82945G Express Chipset Family (Microsoft Corporation - WDDM 1.0)\u0026quot;) or the log shows \u0026ldquo;Microsoft GDI\u0026rdquo; as the renderer, then you are running the OpenGL-crippled \u0026ldquo;Windows\u0026rdquo; driver that is downloaded on a fresh install. Project OutFox will not work on these drivers, as we do not support DirectX anymore (the old D3D renderer that 5.0.12/5.1 has) There is a list of drivers at here but for some of these cards, you need to keep your Windows 7 install disc handy!\nLinux    On Linux, we only provide pre-compiled binaries at this time. Extract the tarball, and run ./stepmania in the directory.\nIf you see an error mentioning that it could not find libOpenGL.so.0:, install libopengl0 from your distribution\u0026rsquo;s package manager.\nmacOS    Open the DMG file and drag the game to your Applications directory.\nUntil we produce a digitally-signed build, you will have to change macOS security settings in order for Project OutFox to operate correctly. macOS prevents access to external files by unsigned apps unless given manual permission by the user.\nTo do this, open Terminal and run the following command: xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/outfox, replacing /path/to/outfox with the path to the directory containing the OutFox executable (manually typing it out, or dragging the folder containing the game executable directly onto the window to fill it automatically). If no errors show up after pressing enter, then you\u0026rsquo;re ready to start the game.\nOn older builds, macOS Catalina also generated a message stating that the game was requesting permission to receive keystrokes from any application. This was a side effect of previous code that has since been removed.\nNext steps    Once Project OutFox is installed, you can move on to setting the game up.\n"},{"id":20,"href":"/dev/actors/General-DifferencesfromOlderSM/","title":"Behavioral differences from SM 3.95/ITG","parent":"Lua and Actors","content":"OpenITG, NotITG and SM 3.95 are popular engines based on older versions of StepMania that have communities that continue to support by making new content.\nSM5.3 contains a similar feature set as the previous revisions of the game, but with some notable differences. This document aims to provide help with porting content to and from the different versions of the game.\n\u0026ldquo;Command\u0026rdquo; format vs \u0026ldquo;Function\u0026rdquo; format    Converting commands to the newer function format is generally recommended when porting content to SM5. The following sections detail what these processes.\n\u0026ldquo;Command\u0026rdquo; format    In SM3.95 \u0026amp; related engines, commands can be defined inside xml nodes like this:\nOnCommand=\u0026#34;x,SCREEN_CENTER_X;y,SCREEN_CENTER_Y;zoom,2;rotationz,180;linear,50;rotationy,-5000;rotationx,750;rotationz,750;sleep,100\u0026#34; (Taken from WinDEU\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Golden Slaughterer\u0026rdquo; file from \u0026ldquo;WinDEU Hates You 5EVR\u0026rdquo;.)\nThis is what can be considered \u0026ldquo;Command\u0026rdquo; format, which allowed for easy chaining of actor functions tweens.\nFor a quick translation into SM5, this can be wrapped with cmd(), but this is considered bad practice and inefficient (And it\u0026rsquo;s still counted as \u0026ldquo;Command\u0026rdquo; format). However, it\u0026rsquo;s used a lot in the past, so it\u0026rsquo;s still here for backwards compatibility.\nAnother thing to note is that the functions inside this format (eg: x, rotationz, zoom, etc.) appear to be case-insensitive, all being converted to lowercase in the end. (Although in SM5, this appears to not be the case.)\n\u0026ldquo;Function\u0026rdquo; format    In SM5, commands can be defined inside lua tables like this:\nOnCommand= function(self) self:x(SCREEN_CENTER_X):y(SCREEN_CENTER_Y):zoom(2):rotationz(180):linear(50):rotationy(-5000):rotationx(750):rotationz(750):sleep(100) end (The function format version of the earlier command)\nThis is what can be considered \u0026ldquo;Function\u0026rdquo; format.\nThis is not exclusive to SM5, however. SM3.95 \u0026amp; friends can use lua functions inside xml nodes. But there is a caveat: Actor function chaining as seen in the example is not possible in SM3.95/OpenITG/NotITG. Instead, a separate self: would be needed for each function call.\nEverything is case-sensitive in this format, so take care to ensure the casing is corrent.\nActor Differences    Because the internals of the engines are different, actors may work differently with the same lines of code.\nZoom and rotation order     SM3.95 (and as a result, OpenITG \u0026amp; NotITG) apply the rotation, then apply the zoom.  SM5 applies the zoom and then applies the rotation.\nIn SM5.3, this can be worked around by setting the rotafterzoom attribute to false, returning the SM3.95 behavior.\nThe notes \u0026amp; receptors already have this active to help with easilly replicating modifier effects from the other engines.\nIn SM5.2 and earlier, this has to be done with wrapper states or actorframes. This is done by having the wrapper do the positioning and zooming, while the main actor gets everything else. (This is still doable in SM5.3 if you\u0026rsquo;re aiming to write content for multiple SM5s)\nZoom\u0026rsquo;s effect on the axis    SM3.95\u0026rsquo;s zoom function only affected the x \u0026amp; y axis, while zoom affects all three axis in SM5.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s fine for actors like Sprites or BitmapTexts, but it stops being \u0026lsquo;normal\u0026rsquo; when actors like Models come into play.\nThis not only affects actors, but also affects modifiers that play with zoom (eg: Mini, Tiny).\nA workaround is to either use only the x \u0026amp; y zooms or undo any scaling done to the z axis when performing a normal zoom.\nActorFrameTexture\u0026rsquo;s capture method.    In NotITG, an ActorFrameTexture (AFT), captures everything that was rendered before it and places it into a texture.\nSM5\u0026rsquo;s AFT captures everything inside of it (Hence, ActorFrameTexture), and places that into a texture.\nThis difference makes for a nontrivial challenge to port content across if AFTs are in use.\nDue to how AFTs work in nITG, lumikey or chromakey shaders are needed if transparent textures of an actor are needed.\nAttribute renames    A few of the attributes got renamed, so when porting content, take care to ensure these are dealt with:\n  effectdelay (SM3.95) becomes effect_hold_at_full (SM5)\n  hidden(0) and hidden(1) (SM3.95) becomes visible(false) and visible(true) (SM5)\n  Scaling across multiple themes    Most themes made for the SM3.95 era are considered \u0026ldquo;480p\u0026rdquo; because it\u0026rsquo;s internal height was always 480 pixels.\nSM5 changes this, with SM5.1\u0026rsquo;s default theme shifting towards a hight of 720 pixels, which can be considered an \u0026ldquo;HD\u0026rdquo; Theme.\nSeveral things have to be scaled in accordance to this, such as:\n Zoom (All axis are involved) Positioning (All axis are involved) Effects (Not all need to be scaled.)   A Common ratio would be this: SCREEN_HEIGHT/intended_height (for SM3.95-style content, intended_height is 480)\nHowever, this does not apply to every actor. If an actor is inside something that\u0026rsquo;s already scaled (eg: the NoteField inside the scaled Player), it does not require the above scaling.\nModifier Differences    Some modifiers have completely different behavior, which can make porting modifier-related content less trivial.\nTiny     In SM5, positive tiny brings the columns together similar to what Mini visually does.  NotITG instead only zooms the notes.\nThe only options are to combine column movement modifiers to counteract the movement, use the column-specific variants instead, or use tinyx \u0026amp; tinyy (which is technically closer to what nITG\u0026rsquo;s Tiny actually does).\nThis only affects the original Tiny modifier, and not its' variants.\n The zoom equation is different. SM5 uses this equation: 0.5^strength, while NotITG uses this one: 1 - 0.5*strength. (100% == 1.0 for the strength)  It just so happens that NotITG\u0026rsquo;s equation is the exact same one Mini uses for notefield zoom.\nIn SM5.3, this can be altered with the TinyUsesMiniCalc sub-modifier. When active, it switches to NotITG\u0026rsquo;s equation, which allows for a wider range of zooms.\nIn SM5.2 and earlier, this can be somewhat replicated by taking the two equations and solving for the equivalent strength. (Doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for negative strengths in NotITG, through)\nThis affects every variant of Tiny.\nDifferences from older SM5 builds    SM5.3 changes the default behavior from the older SM5 builds. This section documents those changes.\nColumn-specific function changes    Instead of typing \u0026lt;mod name\u0026gt;\u0026lt;\\column number\u0026gt; (As in SM5.1), you now type \u0026lt;Mod Name\u0026gt;Col, and the first parameter is the column number. It also allows for mass applications by passing nil as the column number.\nPlayer vanish point    In SM5.2 and earlier (due to a math error), the player\u0026rsquo;s vanish point at the x axis is skewed towards their side of the screen instead of being directly at the center of the notefield. This is not an issue in SM5.0.7 and earlier or in SM5.3 and later.\nFor example: P1 is at the left half of the screen, so its' vanish point is slightly skewed towards the left edge of the screen.\nvibrate() now takes the current zoom into account    This is similar to how it behaves in SM3.95/ITG.\nSM5.1 and earlier take the endpoint zoom and use that for vibrate.\nFor example:\nactor:vibrate():zoom(20):linear(2):zoom(0) Would result in no visible vibration because the end point is 0, while in SM5.3 and SM3.95, one would see the vibration start at 20 and go down as the zoom reaches 0.\nLua is more strict with escape sequences.    In older builds of SM, an invalid escape sequence is ignored, with the offending \\ removed. In lua 5.3 (and consequentally, SM5.3), this now causes a lua error, which may result in themes or effect files not running correctly or at all.\n"},{"id":21,"href":"/dev/effects/EffectFiles-ChartSegments/","title":"Chart segments","parent":"Effect Simfiles","content":"Gimmick charts often involve a large amount of BPM changes or stops to create various effects like stutters, wave-type scrolling or switching notes with other types of notes (ex: notes become mines).\nThis is done with \u0026ldquo;segments\u0026rdquo;. One can have many instances of a segment type.\nThe SSC simfile format has extra \u0026ldquo;segments\u0026rdquo;, which allow for other effects. The following list notes what is available and what it is supposed to do.\nSM-era segments    These segments can be found in .sm files, but they can also be in .ssc files, too.\nBPM changes (BPMS)    Every chart has a BPM, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to stay at one BPM. Some songs do change BPM throughout, but some charts do this for doing stutters (when combined with stops) or having notes speed towards or slow down. Visually ignored if CMod is used (But may result in weird spacing with regards to note quantization).\nIn the simfile, it\u0026rsquo;s listed as the beat the change happens, and then the BPM to change to. The BPM listed at beat 0 is the starting BPM.\nIn SM3.95 and oITG/nITG, negative BPMs can be used to \u0026lsquo;warp\u0026rsquo; through the chart.

Visually ignored if CMod is used.\nThis also makes the beat stop while one is active. (So, if you were printing the beat, it would stop incrementing during the stop segment)\nIn the simfile, it\u0026rsquo;s listed as the beat the stop happens, and then how long the stop is (in seconds).\n#STOPS:27.000=3.141; (ex: at beat 27, the chart stops scrolling for 3.141 seconds)\nKeysounding (KEYSOUNDS)    SSC-era segments    When SSC created the .ssc format, new segment types were added.\nDelay segments (DELAYS)    Warp segments (WARPS)    Tells the game to teleport foreward a given number of beats into a chart. Any notes that are skipped get counted as fake.\nIn simfile, it\u0026rsquo;s listed as the beat it happens, then how many beats foreward to teleport.\n#WARPS:28.000=4.000; (ex: at beat 28, teleport foreward by 4 beats.)\nTime Signature segments (TIMESIGNATURES)    Tick Count segments (TICKCOUNTS)    Sets how many hold ticks happen in a hold per measure. Starting value defaults to 4. Only really used in pump mode, due to other games not having hold checkpoints.\nIn simfile, it\u0026rsquo;s listed as the beat it happens, then the actual tickcount amount.\n#TICKCOUNTS:0.000=4, 28.000=8 (ex: At beat 28, a hit becomes 2 combo, and a miss becomes 4 misses.)\nCombo segments (COMBOS)    Sets how much combo a hit or miss adds. The default is 1/1, which means a hit gets 1 combo and a miss gets 1 miss.\nIn simfile, it\u0026rsquo;s listed as the beat it happens, how much combo a hit is and then how much combo a miss is.

Weird behavior, such as underflows can happen if negative values are used.\n#COMBOS:0.000=1, 28.000=2=4; (ex: At beat 28, a hit becomes 2 combo, and a miss becomes 4 misses.)\nSpeed segments (SPEEDS)    Sets the speed of the chart by ratio. 1 is the normal speed. If given a length of 0, the change happens instantly. The default starts with a speed of 1, applying at beat 0 instantly. Visually ignored if CMod is used.\nIn simfile, it\u0026rsquo;s listed as the beat it happens, the speed to go to, how long the change takes and whether it\u0026rsquo;s in beats or seconds.\n#SPEEDS:0.000=2.000=0.000=0, 16.000=4.000=1.000=0, 24.000=1.000=2.000=1; (ex: Chart starts at a speed of 2, on beat 16, it turns to a speed of 4 in 1 beat, and on beat 24, it turns to a speed of 1 in 2 seconds.\nScroll segments (SCROLLS)    Allows one to alter the scrolling factor for a section (as opposed to the whole field). When given a factor of 0, the chart stops visibly scrollnig, but notes can still be hit. Visually ignored if CMod is used.\nIn simfile, it\u0026rsquo;s listed as the beat it happens, and then the factor to switch to.\n#SCROLLS:0.000=1.000, 24.000=0.000, 28.000=2.000; (ex: The chart starts with a factor of 1, switches to a factor of 0 at beat 24, and switches to a factor of 2 at beat 28)\nFake segments (FAKES)    Allows one to mark a section of the chart as fake, which means the notes can\u0026rsquo;t be hit or judged.\nIn the simfile, it\u0026rsquo;s listed as the beat the fake segment is at, and then how long the section is in beats.\n#FAKES:24.000=8.000; (ex: at beat 24, don\u0026rsquo;t judge the notes for 8 beats)\nLabel segments (LABELS)    Allows one to mark the start of a section with a name.

Here\u0026rsquo;s a quote from Squirrel if you want to know more:\n The project began as a method to add online and profiles to SM5, but when we looked into the engine to see how this could be appropriated it was discovered just how much in a sorry state the code base was, and it looked mostly abandoned. I spoke to Shakesoda in hopes of a resurrection in the form of a team project, and it was requested rather than breaking 10 years of content and community to take the time to make a proper 5.x build that is stable and supports what the community as a whole wants from the game. This backward compatibility support has been an absolute git to do, but it\u0026rsquo;s something now we are down the line which we are proud of, as it has brought many players and newcomers to the community, and provided a very stable experience for folks during the lockdown. We will continue to maintain a near 100% compatibility where we can, and this is taken into consideration whenever we plan a new feature or change engine components.\nWe asked if it was ok to close the source while this process was done, and it was deemed wise for the health of the repo and the need of people who are just wanting to play. Its why we\u0026rsquo;ve been around the repo but not on it as taint can happen and we do not wish this. SSC did this same behaviour before us, so we did not see it as a problem. Some vocal members of the community disagreed, including some of the SMDev Team. We have also been compared to past SM repo contributors who may have left a less than savoury memory in the minds of some, and it has also been hard to differentiate from history we have no involvement with.\n Q: I have a really recent processor and my game is having a lot of problems, why is that?    Outfox reached a point of optimization that good processors are going to have some problems because some parts of the game are going too fast and need catch up. The current solution to this is to have something running in the background (Have a video playing, other programs) to keep the processor busy.\nThis is going to have a proper fix later.\nQ: Is online mode available yet? If not, is it coming?    Short answer: no it\u0026rsquo;s not available, yes it\u0026rsquo;s coming. Long answer: It\u0026rsquo;ll take a while, the engine is still being optimized and the online system is still in development (being done by Cube).\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean Online isn\u0026rsquo;t important for us, it\u0026rsquo;s a lot, it was one of Team Rizu first plans but the engine just wasn\u0026rsquo;t ready for their plans.\nResume: As your read this, both the game engine and online mode are still in development.\nQ: How do I insert Noteskins/Themes/Avatars/Judgments/Toasties into StepMania?

Project OutFox supports a variety of game types, which simulate different types of rhythm games (including button layouts and, where applicable, gameplay behaviours specific to the game type). Game types are further divided into styles, which include chart types such as single, double, etc.\n dance - The default game type. Similar to games such as Dance Dance Revolution and In the Groove, it uses four lanes in the cardinal directions (left, down, up, right). It also contains a 6-lane style (solo) adding up-left and up-right directions, and a 3-lane style using only up-left, down, and up-right. pump - A five-lane dance game, which uses four diagional directions and the center rather than cardinal directions. In terms of functionality and behavior it is in line with Pro/StepMania 4 CVS. kb7 - A seven-lane game type designed primarily for keyboard play, with two sets of three keys flanking a centre column (usually mapped by default to the SDF, JKL, and space keys). This is a StepMania-specific game type that does not emulate any specific game. ez2 - A game type based on the defunct arcade dance game EZ2Dancer, which uses three foot panels and a pair of hand sensors. para - A dance game designed for para para routines, which is typically played with five infrared hand sensors in a semicircular layout, and uses a considerably looser scoring system. It is modelled upon the mechanics of the defunct arcade dance game Para Para Paradise. ds3ddx - A dance game whose format is common among Chinese arcade dance games, which uses four diagional foot panels, and four hand sensors around the pad in the cardinal directions. beat - Supports 5-key and 7-key styles, and the ability to load BMS files. Full BME/BML support is coming soon. maniax - A game type based on the defunct arcade dance game Dance Maniax, which uses four hand sensors arranged into two columns (upper and lower). techno - A dance game type designed for pads with nine panels, including 4-lane (similar to dance), 5-lane (similar to pump), 8-lane (using all but the center panel), and 9-lane styles in single and double versions. popn - A PMS player mode, supporting 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9-button styles, and the ability to load PMS files. gddm - A drum mode supporting six-part (five drums and one pedal) and nine-part (seven drums, bass pedal, hi-hat pedal) styles, modelled upon the mechanics of the arcade rhythm game DrumMania. 5 and 10-part with full DTX file support coming soon. gdgf (formerly guitar prior to 5.3.0-alpha-4.9.8) - A guitar mode supporting three-fret and five-fret styles, modelled upon the mechanics of the arcade rhythm game Guitar Freaks. gh - A five-fret guitar mode modelled upon the mechanics of once-popular console games originating from North America. kickbox - Obscure lash-a-soft dance pad-to-a-punching-bag mode (four, six, and eight-sensor modes).  Tip: You can switch between game types at any time using the \u0026ldquo;Select Game\u0026rdquo; button on the main menu.  Configuring your controls    Each game type has its own default keyboard configuration; dance, for example, maps the first player to the arrow keys (when playing on keyboard, this is often referred to as the \u0026ldquo;index\u0026rdquo; playstyle). To configure your button mappings, go to Options \u0026gt; Input \u0026amp; Calibration \u0026gt; Config Key/Joy Mappings.\nUse the arrow keys to select an item to map, press Enter, and then press the button on the keyboard or controller you want to use. You can have multiple button assignments for each command.\nProject OutFox supports a wide variety of controllers and even arcade hardware. By default, the game operates with a HIDAPI and XInput-compliant input engine. If your controller does not perform as well or function as expected, you can switch to the alternate XInput input mode from the Experimental Options menu. XInput will sometimes also require you to map your controller to the input engine\u0026rsquo;s virtual gamepad, allowing the game to properly interface with the device. The Map Controller screen is available from the Input \u0026amp; Calibration menu.\nCalibrate your audio sync    !\u0026gt; Notice: Interactive calibration only works under the dance game type. If you are using a differtent game type, temporarily switch to dance, and switch back when you are done.\nIn a rhythm game, timing is everything. But latency produced by your audio outputs can affect your accuracy. You can interactively adjust the audio offset using the Calibrate Audio Sync option in the Input \u0026amp; Calibration menu.\nA song will play with a pattern of alternating notes; in the dance game type, they will be left and right arrows. Tap them to the rhythm based on what you hear. Every 24 notes, your inputs will be used to calculate a new offset; watch for \u0026ldquo;Perfect\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Flawless\u0026rdquo; judgements.\nThe song will continue playing on a loop until you exit with the Back button (mapped to Escape by default), after which you will be given an opportunity to save the changes. If you wish to calibrate in-game with your song of choice, you can press F6 twice during gameplay to enable AutoSync Machine, which will last until the end of the song or when exited with the Back button. A message will appear asking to confirm your changes and if you wish to apply them or not.\nCreate a profile    While Project OutFox can save some data to a global \u0026ldquo;machine profile\u0026rdquo;, it is recommended that you create a local profile so you can save personal high scores, as well as player settings (such as modifiers) that can persist between sessions.\nYou coan manage profiles from Options \u0026gt; Profiles. From here you can create a profile, and edit existing profiles.\nFrom the profile editor (highlight a profile and press Start, and then select \u0026ldquo;Edit profile\u0026rdquo;), you can input fitness-related information, change the layout of the optional \u0026ldquo;Detailed Stats\u0026rdquo; pane during gameplay, and add an avatar to your profile (avatars are loaded from the Appearance/Avatars directory).\nInstall songs    While Project OutFox does include a few sample songs, you will probably want to add more. We support a number of formats, including SM, SSC, SMA, DWI, BMS, and KSF.\nThe Songs folder in Project OutFox is divided into Groups (also sometimes known as \u0026ldquo;packs\u0026rdquo;). Groups, in turn, contain folders for each song.\nSongs │ └───My Group │ │ │ └───My Song │ │ mysong.ssc │ │ mysong.ogg │ │ mysong-bg.png │ │ mysong-bn.png │ │ mysong-jk.png For example, we will use a pack known as Club Fantastic Volume 1, which features legally-unencumbered songs with dance charts for all difficulties. Download the pack from its website using the link labelled \u0026ldquo;Song Pack for StepMania players (\u0026ldquo;null offset\u0026rdquo;).\u0026rdquo;, and extract it into the Songs folder. Then start the game, and it should appear on the song selection screen.\nNote: If the songs do not appear, be sure to check if the group folder actually containing the song folders is too deep in the folder hierarchy.  Note: If a song is not contained inside a group folder, but instead on the root Songs directory, the game will stop loading to let you know of the Song folder in question.  Next steps    The only thing left to do is have fun!

This system is based off the spline system used in NotITG, which means it is usable alongside the pre-existing SM5 spline system and other modifiers, too.\nPoints are positioned like they are for Gradient modifiers, meaning in multiples of ARROW_SIZE away from the receptor.\nIn SM5, this is only accessible through the PlayerOptions functions, while NotITG has functions available in Player and also has modstring versions available (Though, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to use the lua functions instead.)\nPoint and column numbering start at 1 in SM5, while it starts at 0 in NotITG.\nTo stop the current chain of spline points, a \u0026lsquo;null point\u0026rsquo; (Where both position and magnitude are at zero) can be used as a \u0026lsquo;null terminator\u0026rsquo; or sorts. This is only applicable for points after the first.\nThe following types are avaiable for modsplines (designated as \u0026lt;axis\u0026gt;):\n X (Positioning on the x axis, affects receptors \u0026amp; notes. Works in multiples of ARROW_SIZE) Y (Positioning on the y axis, affects receptors \u0026amp; notes. Works in multiples of ARROW_SIZE. The quirks of SpiralY apply here if holds or rolls are involved.) Z (Positioning on the z axis, affects receptors \u0026amp; notes. Works in multiples of ARROW_SIZE) RotX (Rotation on the x axis, affects notes only. Works in radians. Known as \u0026ldquo;RotationX\u0026rdquo; in NotITG, but uses RotX for functions. Also affects hold heads in SM5 without extra mods needed.) RotY (Rotation on the y axis, affects notes only. Works in radians. Known as \u0026ldquo;RotationY\u0026rdquo; in NotITG, but uses RotY for functions. Also affects hold heads in SM5 without extra mods needed.) RotZ (Rotation on the z axis, affects notes only. Works in radians. Known as \u0026ldquo;RotationZ\u0026rdquo; in NotITG, but uses RotZ for functions. Also affects hold heads in SM5 without extra mods needed.) Zoom (Zoom all three axis with the Mini calculations, affects receptors \u0026amp; notes. Known as \u0026ldquo;Size\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Tiny\u0026rdquo; (Modstring only) or \u0026ldquo;Zoom\u0026rdquo; (Modstring only) in NotITG) SkewX (Aribtrary amounts of skewx, affects receptors \u0026amp; notes. Works like NoteSkewX. Known as \u0026ldquo;Skew\u0026rdquo; in NotITG) SkewY (Arbitrary amounts of skewy, affects receptors \u0026amp; notes. Works like NoteSkewY. Not available in NotITG v4.0) Stealth (Arbitrary amounts of stealth.)  The limit is 40 points per axis per column.\nModSplineEnable    Desc: This function turns on/off splines for the designated axis, allowing for saving performance when modsplines are not needed. In NotITG, this does not exist, as modsplines are always \u0026lsquo;on\u0026rsquo;.\nQuirks: This does not clear the modsplines themselves.\nPlayerOptions format: ModSpline(\u0026lsquo;ModSplineAxis_\u0026lt;axis\u0026gt;\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lt;enable\u0026gt;)\nModSpline    Desc: This function sets the spline point to have a given position and magnitude.\nQuirks: The position is not tweenable. Giving only three first three parameters returns the current value, position and rate for the point. Using this will not enable modsplines for the given axis.

An actor can have a name and commands. These commands could be anything, as long as it\u0026rsquo;s suffixed with a Command or MessageCommand, depending on the type of commands needed.\nNames allow one to easily grab the actor through functions like GetChild, but there are other exampled given later.\nWhen the definition is complete, the actor has to be \u0026ldquo;returned\u0026rdquo; for the game to see it. Most of the time, ActorFrames are usually what\u0026rsquo;s returned instead of just a single actor.\nActorFrames and how to build them    ActorFrames can hold other actors. The Def. format is set up like any other lua table, allowing for creating actors in batches. Because of this, there are multiple ways to build an ActorFrame.\nInline building    Actors can be explicitly placed into an ActorFrame like this:\nDef.ActorFrame{ Def.Actor{ --Commands and stuff go here. }, Def.Sprite{ --More commands and stuff go here. } } Concatenation    Because lua tables can be concatenated (added) to each other, so can ActorFrames.\nThis can allow for programatically creating Actors in batches as needed.\nHowever, if one does not plan on creating actors programmaticly, then a simple return Def.ActorFrame{... is all that\u0026rsquo;s needed. Storing it into a local variable that gets returned will waste resources.\nThere are two ways to add onto an actorframe.\nMethod 1 (indexing):\nlocal t = Def.ActorFrame{ Def.Sprite{ --commands \u0026amp; stuff }, Def.BitmapText{ --who even knows }, } t[#t+1] = Def.Actor{ --It\u0026#39;s the third actor } return t Method 2 (lua concatenation):\nreturn Def.ActorFrame{ Def.Sprite{ --commands \u0026amp; stuff }, Def.BitmapText{ --who even knows }, } .. Def.Actor{ --It\u0026#39;s the third actor } Commands    Commands come in two variants: \u0026ldquo;Commands\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Messages\u0026rdquo;.\nCommands are usually isolated to a single actor, with a few exceptions. Messages are commands that are meant to be in multiple actors and can be invoked at around the same time on all actors with a \u0026ldquo;Broadcast\u0026rdquo;.\nMESSAGEMAN:Broadcast(\u0026#34;SpecialMove\u0026#34;, {funnymove = 10, absolute = false}) (ex: this would run \u0026ldquo;SpecialMoveMessageCommand\u0026rdquo; on all actors that have this command defined, with a parameter table being passed in. Not all actors might use this table, even though they might have the command defined.)\nIf one needs to manually queue a command or message, the queuecommand or queuemessage functions can be used.\nThese queued commands run only after all previous tweens have finished.\nIf a command has to run instantly, playcommand can be used for that.\nIf one wants to pass custom parameters into the command, a single table has to be used to wrap every parameter passed.\nThese command functions generally take two paramters: The actor calling the function (often called self), and the parameters table passed into the command. The paramters table is optional.\nObtaining Childs and ActorFrame Levels    When using Actors, you can use self:GetParent() and self:GetChild() to get elements from other ActorFrames or actors. (Note: GetChild can only be used by ActorFrames.)\nYou can think of an ActorFrame as a tree of objects. This is the original table. And now you\u0026rsquo;ve called GetParent on the ActorProxy.\nDef.ActorFrame{ Def.BitmapText{}, * Def.ActorProxy{}, } When calling it, you go back up a level, which in this case, it will become ActorFrame.\n* Def.ActorFrame{ Def.BitmapText{}, [] Def.ActorProxy{}, } In this new location, we get the MyText actor, which can be achieved by calling the GetChild command. The command uses a String argument, but can also grab from nested tables in case of an ActorFrame not having actors with names assigned. On those cases, actors are just indexed on that ActorFrame set.\nExample Without Names    Def.ActorFrame{ OnCommand=function(self) -- If we want to get to the BitmapText, we\u0026#39;ll need to get the second entry on the ActorFrame. self:GetChild(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;)[2] -- returns the BitmapText actor. end, Def.Sprite{}, Def.BitmapText{} } Example With Names    Def.ActorFrame{ OnCommand=function(self) -- If we want to get to the BitmapText, we\u0026#39;ll need to get the \u0026#34;Text\u0026#34; actor. self:GetChild(\u0026#34;Text\u0026#34;) -- returns the BitmapText actor. end, Def.Sprite{ Name = \u0026#34;Image\u0026#34; }, Def.BitmapText{ Name = \u0026#34;Text\u0026#34; } } "},{"id":26,"href":"/dev/mods/Mods-12-Chart-Mods/","title":"Chart modifiers","parent":"Guide to Modifiers","content":"Chart Modifiers    Chart modifiers affect the chart itself, meaning what has to be stepped changes.

OH NO! (I will get to this)    Test your input, see if your keys are mapped and if so which ones. By pushing the buttons on the pad it’ll say something to the effect of “Key B 12 – Not Mapped” and if you step/press on the key and nothing shows up it’s not mapped, no big proceed to the next step to set it up.\nStep 2: The Easy Way    So on to the good stuff; 5.3 has a built in gamepad tool that will automatically take care of most of this for you\nYou push “Enter” on the keyboard and push the appropriate button on the dance pad/etc. to map the buttons to the button you want.\nI would recommend using this screen for most controllers on pc, it takes a lot of the guess work out of the whole thing. After setting this up repeat Step 1 if your keys show up as “Unmapped” that’s great go to the “Config Key/Joy Mappings” and do your thing, you’re done with the guide!\nIf it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026hellip;\nStep 3: The not super intuitive way (SDL2 Gamepad Tool)    There is a nifty tool around called SDL2 Gamepad Tool. You connect your controller (via USB or Bluetooth or however you desire to connect your controller to the PC), and it’ll show up on the top drop down menu.\n Click \u0026ldquo;Create a New Mapping\u0026rdquo; Step/Press the input you want for those buttons much like you would on Step 2 of this procedure. Skip the rest. Save the Mapping String. Copy the Mapping String. Go to where you installed the game, and paste the string into Data/gamecontrollerdb.txt  A note    The “#” is useful for when you want to have different Mapping Strings for the same gamepad, it basically hides the mapping string from the program reading it. I made 3 different mapping for testing the the program would only recognize one, then I hid the mapping string with a hashtag (pound symbol for you oldies around) and the one not hidden was now seen by the program.\nBasically, don’t do multiple mapping strings on the same controller (even if you change the name); the program will work with one at a time and honestly one is all you need. You should be good to go and repeat Step 1 and then go to “Config Key/Joy Mappings” right after and set up your pad.\nStill isn\u0026rsquo;t working?    This hasn’t quite happened to me (I tried with the PS3 DDR mat) but there are 2 types of controllers, a “Hat” type and not. So let’s say for example you hook up a pad/controller and the Dpad you configured up down left and right but “Config Key/Joy Mappings” only allows you to push one of them and the rest don’t work.\nTry configuring the directions to the analog stick instead and then mapping them again. I don’t think you should have to but it works, I’ve tested this with my PS4 Controller and in fact you can play with analog input.\nXInput interfering with HIDAPI mode, and breaking axis pads    If you have an axis pad which is showing two sets of buttons, or simply just cancelling out, and you cannot seem to map it in game, this is what you need to do to fix it. The pad showing two buttons will look like this:\nI am pressing the left Arrow, but getting two sets of inputs. On Linux and MacOS, this can be due to an installed xbox360 driver, or the xpad module intercepting the events, and reporting an axis anyway. The next patch of OutFox mitigates this issue a little bit, but it still is a pain.\nTo fix this, you need to write down the BUTTON numbers shown on screen, so you get a list for all four arrows:\nDown=Joy1_Button 2 Left=Joy1_Button 1 Right=Joy1_Button 4 Up=Joy1_Button 3 Make sure that you close the game. You can now navigate to your save folder, and look for your keymaps.ini file and set the buttons manually, so you can basically ignore the axis values given by the xpad driver. you need to add the mapping before the ::: as shown below:\nYou can save this, and then start the game again, and your pad will be mapped.\nDown=Joy1_Button 2 Left=Joy1_Button 1 Right=Joy1_Button 4 Up=Joy1_Button 3 Make sure that you close the game.

Modifiers (or Mods) apply all kinds of effects to the notes in a song - they can make the notes scroll in different directions, bounce to the beat, and many, many more things!\n You can manually turn on modifiers on any song by entering the player options menu (press start twice when you pick a song to play), and choosing Modifiers then Exit at the bottom. Mods in the Acceleration, Effects, Appearance, and Scroll categories work best for attacks - feel free to play around!\n Attacks are one of the easiest ways to add Modifiers to your simfile - Attacks will apply whatever mods you want at specific times you set in the song!\nFor StepMania 5/Outfox-based arcade cabinets (and SM5-based games like PIU Infinity), Attacks can even be used in USB custom songs and charts (if enabled)!\nAdding Attacks to a Simfile    We\u0026rsquo;ll assume you\u0026rsquo;ve already created a simfile, and know a bit about how to use the editor here.\nFirst off:\n  Open a Simfile in the Outfox editor (Title Screen \u0026gt; Edit/Share \u0026gt; Edit Songs/Steps). Pick a song, then pick a difficulty (chart).\n  When editing the chart, press Enter where you want the Modifier to start.\n  Choose Modifiy attacks at current beat at the bottom of the menu.\n   Choose Add Attack\n  Here, you\u0026rsquo;ll enter a Modifier to get applied:\n Many modifiers from the Player Options menu will work (Beat, Drunk, etc), for now just type Beat and press Enter. Any attacks you add will show up to the right of the notes, both when editing and playing a simfile in the editor.     Press P to play your song - you should see the attack you added scroll up the screen with the notes.\n When the attack with your Beat modifier scrolls to the top of the screen, the arrows will start bouncing to the beat!    Editing/Removing Attacks    Attacks only last a few seconds by default - to make it last longer you\u0026rsquo;ll need to edit the attack\u0026rsquo;s length.\nEdit an Attack      In the editor, go to the beat where the Attack you want to edit is, and press Enter.\n  All Attacks on that beat are listed - pick the one you want to edit (arrow keys/enter).\n If you don\u0026rsquo;t see the attack you just added, make sure you\u0026rsquo;re lined up to the Exact time the Attack is at!    From here, press Enter on any of these options to change them:\n Starting time: When this attack starts. It\u0026rsquo;s better to remove/re-add an attack if you want to change when it starts. Seconds Remaining: How long the attack lasts (defalt: 5 seconds) Attack 1: The mod you just added - press enter to change Add Mod: Pick this to add another mod to this attack    Remove an Attack      In the editor, go to the beat the Attack is on and press Enter.\n  Pick the attack you want to remove and press Enter.\n  Pick the Mod you want to remove and press Enter.\n  When asked for a new Mod, backspace all the letters in the mod and press Enter.\n When all Mods in an attack are removed, the Attack is auto-removed.    Mod Strength/Approach Rate    Mod Strength    Is Beat too wild? Not wild enough? You can fix that!\n To change how strong a mod is, add a percentage before it, like 50% Beat\n By default, any mods you add default to 100%. You can dial this down if you don\u0026rsquo;t want a mod to be as strong.\nPercentages above 100% are a-ok if you want really strong mods! Negative percentages like -50% Beat work too if you want to totally invert an effect (it might not be obvious on all mods, but it does work).\nFinally: No means the same thing as 0%. Say, if you have a Beat attack earlier in the song, you can turn it off with 0% Beat or No Beat - either works!\nThe difference between 50% Beat and 100% Beat\n In the above video - Left = 40% Beat, Right = 125% Beat\n  Mod Approach Rate    Want a mod to slowly fade in over time, or instantly go to max strength? You can change that too!\n To change how fast/slow a mod is applied, add a * and a number before the mod, like *2 Beat\n Higher numbers apply mods faster, lower numbers (decimals included!) make mods apply slower.\n*0.5 = Half as fast, *2 = Twice as fast.\n(The default *1 applies at a rate of 100% of a mod over 1 second)\n Mod approach rate can also combine with any strength, including 0%! If you want to get rid of a mod really fast, you can use an attack like *50 0% Beat.\n The difference between *0.5 Beat and *10 Beat\n In the above video - Left = *0.5 Beat (fades in half as fast), Right = *10 Beat (fades in 10x as fast!). They both get to the same strength at the end, but the left side takes longer to do so.\n Resources/What\u0026rsquo;s Next    Next up is to play around with Modifiers! Experiment with what effects you can get, and discover what you do/don\u0026rsquo;t like!\n What Mods Can I Use?    Lots, actually!\n Check out the Guide to Mods in the sidebar for a list of mods you can use!\n  Mods Resources      FMS Cat\u0026rsquo;s Flip-Invert site helps give you combinations of various mods to move the note columns across the screen. Just drag the receptors where you want them on-screen!\n (You can alternatively use the MoveX/Y/Zn mods to move single note columns, like MoveX1, MoveX2, etc)    Check out WinDEU\u0026rsquo;s Marathon Tutorial series - it focuses on older versions of StepMania (where some mods, like Drunk and Tipsy, have different names), but a lot of the info still applies to SM5/Outfox. The later videos in the series dive really deep into how some mods behave!\n How to set up Mods in Courses in also covered in earlier videos in the series (though again, focusing on older versions of StepMania)    You can join Project Outfox\u0026rsquo;s Discord server for more help from the community - feel free to ask mods/attacks-related questions in channels like #mods-coding-help.\n   My Mods Don\u0026rsquo;t Work!     Double check you\u0026rsquo;ve spelled your Mod name right - mods from older versions of the game (like OpenITG) may have different names in SM5/Outfox! You may get strange behavior if you add new attacks into a simfile before the last attack in the file.   Mod Behaviors Across Different Themes    Some mods you add (like Drunk, Tornado, Boomerang) may change behavior depending on the theme you\u0026rsquo;re currently using.\nIn older versions (like Stepmania 5.0/5.1), the theme\u0026rsquo;s internal resolution (HD vs non-HD themes, specifically SCREEN_HEIGHT) is used in calculations for certain mods. On these versions, these mods will behave differently on themes with different internal resolutions.\nIn Outfox, these calculations are performed based on a completely separate theme metric instead, ModifierHeight. If the theme changes this value, it will affect those calculations (and therefore mod behaviors, and is noted as doing so).\nPlan accordingly if you plan on playing your simfiles/chart edits on different versions/themes!\n Other Notes     Mods obey stops and BPM changes in songs. If your song stops while a mod like Beat is in effect, the notes will freeze in the middle of Beat\u0026rsquo;s animation, skewed to the sides. Earlier versions of StepMania can round the time a mod starts at if you save and exit a simfile in the editor, making it harder/impossible to edit in the future. If this happens, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to manually edit the mod lines under the #ATTACKS tag in your simfile\u0026rsquo;s .sm/.ssc files.

The difficulty can range between \u0026ldquo;trivial to read\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;may as well memorize the chart\u0026rdquo;.\nOften called \u0026ldquo;Modfiles\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Modcharts\u0026rdquo;.\nThese usually use the FGCHANGES or BGCHANGES of a simfile to load the lua files (if any are used).\nDisclaimer: Make sure you\u0026rsquo;ve got making a chart down before starting to make modcharts! Good mods can\u0026rsquo;t save a bad chart!\nHow to Apply Modifiers    There are a few ways to go about this, and it varys depending on what version of SM is being used.\nApplyGameCommand (SM3.95/oITG/nITG)    ApplyGameCommand is a GameState function that provides a way to send modifiers among other commands. The first paramter is the command type followed by the parameters. (In this case, a modstring) The second parameter is what player to apply the command (1 = player 1). If not specified, it applies to all players.\nGAMESTATE:ApplyGameCommand(\u0026#34;mod, *0.5 420 beat\u0026#34;, 1) While it\u0026rsquo;s still available in SM5 (including SM5.3), it\u0026rsquo;s not recommended because it applies mods to the \u0026ldquo;Preferred\u0026rdquo; ModsLevel, which means modifiers apply instantly (no transition), and they persist outside of the simfile. SM5.2 Doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have this function available.\n#MODS (Course files, SM3.95/oITG/nITG/SM5)    Old modfiles used to require going into marathon mode to play the scripted modifiers. Unlike most things, this is time-based due to charts being able to have stops.\n#MODS:TIME=0.000:END=10.000:MODS=*0.5 420 beat; #MODS:TIME=5.000:LEN=1.600:MODS=*2 50 stealth; (ex: Beat starts at 0 seconds and ends at 10. Stealth turns on at 5 seconds and ends 1.6 seconds later)\nNowadays, this is considered obsolete in favor of lua-powered modifiers. It\u0026rsquo;s still usuable in SM5.\n#ATTACKS (Simfiles, nITG/SM5)    Allows for the application of modifiers similar to what course files have. The syntax is exactly the same, just with MODS becoming ATTACKS.\n#ATTACKS:TIME=0.000:END=10.000:MODS=*0.5 420 beat; #ATTACKS:TIME=5.000:LEN=1.600:MODS=*2 50 stealth; nITG accepts #ATTACKS or #MODS inside the .sm file, while SM5 only accepts #ATTACKS in sm \u0026amp; ssc.\nThese do not load in course mode, however.\nApplyModifiers (nITG)    A dedicated function for applying modifiers without needing the processing overhead and \u0026ldquo;mod, \u0026quot; that ApplyGameCommand does.\nGAMESTATE:ApplyModifiers(\u0026#34;*0.5 420 beat\u0026#34;, 1) Often used as a replacement for ApplyGameCommand in nITG modfiles.\nPlayerOptions functions (SM5)    Every modifier has a setter function in PlayerOptions. This can be used in place of other functions. These are case-sensitive, though. If using strings, they\u0026rsquo;ll have to be parsed to make use of these functions.\nlocal po = {GAMESTATE:GetPlayerState(0):GetPlayerOptions(\u0026#39;ModsLevel_Song\u0026#39;), GAMESTATE:GetPlayerState(1):GetPlayerOptions(\u0026#39;ModsLevel_Song\u0026#39;)} po[1]:Beat(4.2, 0.5) SetPlayerOptions (SM5)    This function works by resetting the PlayerOptions for the given level, and setting it according to the string.\nGAMESTATE:GetPlayerState(PLAYER_1):SetPlayerOptions(\u0026#39;ModsLevel_Song\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;*0.5 420 beat\u0026#39;) Because it resets PlayerOptions, it might not be so useful for applying scripted modifiers.\nFromString (SM5.1 and onwards)    Like how ApplyModifiers is specifically for modstrings in nITG, FromString provides direct access to the string parser used for modifiers in ApplyGameCommand, and works very much like how ApplyGameCommand would.\nlocal po = {GAMESTATE:GetPlayerState(0):GetPlayerOptions(\u0026#39;ModsLevel_Song\u0026#39;), GAMESTATE:GetPlayerState(1):GetPlayerOptions(\u0026#39;ModsLevel_Song\u0026#39;)} po[1]:FromString(\u0026#34;*0.5 420 beat\u0026#34;) Modfile templates    Starting to make a modfile can seem really daunting if one does not know how to begin. Luckilly, there are many templates out there to help with creating modfiles.\nOnes made for Open/NotITG and SM3.95 are usually done with .xml files, and some rare .lua files.\nOnes made for SM5 are almost always .lua files.\nStepMania 5 templates      MTK\u0026rsquo;s SM5.3 port of Exschwasion\u0026rsquo;s easing template\n https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HfCFvTHZUI4dO_eAk4iN5mO3H61caHzE Lost of local variables used up in the main scope to preserve syntax.

Often used in modfiles to mimic crs-style resetting. Only available in modstring form right now.\nQuirks: N/A\nModstring format: clearall\nHoldGrainMult    Desc: Adds a multiplier to the \u0026lsquo;step size\u0026rsquo; of holds, allowing one to control how \u0026lsquo;granular\u0026rsquo; a hold is. In NotITG, this is known as \u0026ldquo;granulate\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;grain\u0026rdquo; (alias).\nNegative values make the hold smoother (with a \u0026lsquo;limit\u0026rsquo; of -93.75% which results in a step size of 1 pixel), but could cost performance due to the extra calculations being done. Positive values make the hold look more polygonal (with no real limit). Very noticable on modifiers that work on position, like Drunk.\nCommon values can range from practically anywhere due to it being a multiplier. Try starting with -50% or 100% and go further if extra points or less points are desired.\nQuirks: In NotITG, this modifier works a bit differently. At 0%, the holds are drawn with the normal stepsize, but the magnitude when nonzero controls the step size in pixels (100% = step size of 1 pixel, 400% = step size of 4 pixels (normal in NotITG)). This means NotITG can have step sizes below 1 pixel.\nPlayerOptions format: HoldGrainMult(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: HoldGrainMult(4, 2)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; holdgrainmult\nExample: *2 400% holdgrainmult\nHoldGrainMult video example\nExtendHolds    Desc: Adds a multiplier to the visual length of holds.

NotITG has an alias called \u0026ldquo;gayholds\u0026rdquo;, which applies negative straightholds (so 100% gayholds = -100% straightholds). There is also a column-specific variant.\nCommon values range from -100 to 200%\nQuirks: N/A\nAvailable variants (modstring): straightholds, gayholds (NotITG negative alias), straightholds\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, gayholds\u0026lt;column\u0026gt; (NotITG negative alias for straightholds\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;)\nPlayerOptions format: StraightHolds(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: StraightHolds(1, 0.2)\nColumn-specific format: StraightHoldsCol(\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: StraightHoldsCol(3, 2, 0.5)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modstring variant\u0026gt;\nExample: *0.2 100% straightholds *0.5 200% straightholds3\nStraightHolds video example\nNotePath    Desc: Draws a line that shows the path a note takes to the receptor and beyond, which means it depends on all position mods that are in the game. Known as \u0026ldquo;arrowpath\u0026rdquo; in NotITG. Effectively a \u0026lsquo;hold\u0026rsquo; that lasts the whole notefield, so it could hurt performance depending on what mods are being used. Has a column-specific variant available which is additive like Stealth \u0026amp; Dark.\nCommon values range from -100 to 100% due to the additive nature.\nQuirks: N/A\nAvailable variants (modstring): notepath, notepath\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, arrowpath (NotITG name), arrowpath\u0026lt;column\u0026gt; (NotITG name)\nPlayerOptions format: NotePath(\u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: NotePath(1, 0.4)\nColumn-specific format: NotePathCol(\u0026lt;column\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt;)\nExample: NotePathCol(4, 1, 0.4)\nModstring format: *\u0026lt;approach rate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;magnitude\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modstring variant\u0026gt;\nExample: *0.4 100% notepath *0.4 100% notepath4\nNotePath video example\nAvailable sub modifiers:    NotePathBlendMode    Desc: Set the blend mode used for the NotePath.

It allows for different \u0026lsquo;looks\u0026rsquo; for the notepath. For example, \u0026ldquo;DrawMode_Fan\u0026rdquo; creates a veil-type visual with 50% NotePath, while \u0026ldquo;DrawMode_Lines\u0026rdquo; creates a dotted line.\nThis does not have a modstring form and does not reset with a clearall.\nPlayerOptions format: NotePathDrawMode(\u0026lt;draw mode\u0026gt;)\nNotePathGrainMult    Desc: Allows for adjusting the step size like what HoldGrainMult does for holds.

Unlike NoteSkin, this allows for changing the noteskin mid-song.\nWhen used on a single column, the receptors will not change.\nWhen \u0026lt;column\u0026gt; is nil, all columns will use the requested noteskin, and the receptors will change to match.\nQuirks: Requires a Preferences.ini for the song that lists the noteskins to load. May not play nice when the noteskin isn\u0026rsquo;t loaded. NOTESKIN:DoesNoteSkinExist could be used to ensure the noteskin exists before setting.

(This is separate from the Name attribute)\nFor example, the layer tagged as ZZZActor gets sorted to be after Special, even though it was written the other way around.\nCreating the .lua equivalent manually.    return Def.ActorFrame{ -- Special -- Def.Sprite{ Texture=\u0026#34;funny.png\u0026#34;, OnCommand= function(self) SCREENMAN:SystemMessage(\u0026#39;hi\u0026#39;) end, }, -- Sprite -- GAMESTATE:IsHumanPlayer(PLAYER_1) and Def.Sprite{ Texture=\u0026#34;circle\u0026#34;, } or Def.Actor{}, -- ZZZActor -- Def.Quad{ Texture=\u0026#34;funny.png\u0026#34;, InitCommand=function(self) self:visible(false) end, OnCommand=function(self) self:sleep(1000) end, }, } Often, the main xml file is an ActorFrame, with the inner actors matching the layout of the xml after sorting.\nConditions can be turned into ternary expressions, though they now run at different times compared to the original xml file.\nJust like in ini files, commands have to be turned into function format.\nThe commands that are already in function format are mostly 1:1. The \u0026ldquo;% \u0026quot; that are around the functions must be removed.\n"},{"id":36,"href":"/dev/translation/","title":"Translation","parent":"Developers and Creators","content":"Translation    Translating themes    Are you translating a theme to another language? Reading this might help you.\nWhere are language files stored    Inside every theme there\u0026rsquo;ll be a Languages folder. Inside that folder is where language files are stored. Example:\nLanguages/ en.ini ja.ini Here we can see 2 language files: en for English and ja for Japanese. It\u0026rsquo;s a standard to name language files in that format (language-COUNTRY.ini). For example: In this case, there\u0026rsquo;s a Portuguese translation, but since there\u0026rsquo;s also Portuguese from Portugal, the file was named pt-BR (BR = Brazil).\nFallback    You probably already noticed a _fallback theme in the themes folder, but in case you didn\u0026rsquo;t: it\u0026rsquo;s where things that are necessary for every theme gets stored, so when someone is making a theme the game doesn\u0026rsquo;t blow up. The same goes for Languages: it\u0026rsquo;s important to also translate the fallback for your language because the theme you\u0026rsquo;re translating might not have every string that it uses on it\u0026rsquo;s own folder.\nStarting a translation    To start your work, create a new file for your language(-COUNTRY, if needed) and don\u0026rsquo;t forget to use the .ini extension. You can do this on Notepad with no problem but it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to use a editor like Visual Studio Code or Notepad++.\nNow open en.ini and your new language file, then copy all the content from en.ini to your language file. You can close en.ini now.\nWhat you should translate    This is an code example taken from Soundwaves theme.\n[Common] WindowTitle=Project OutFox StepMania=Project OutFox # Dedicated Character Display strings ModelLoadError=Model for %s (%s) Has a invalid model. Please check if the model.txt file is correctly named and formatted. ModelAnimLoadError=An animation file for %s\u0026#39;s model (%s) is invalid or non-existant. Please check the animation folders and see if there\u0026#39;s any file missing. LocationLoadError=Current Location (%s) is missing its location model. Please check if the model.txt file is correctly named and formatted. SongLoaderSingleSong=Random Song Play: Current Folder only contains 1 song. OutFox might get confused when picking the song via random. Selecting to index 1. SongLoaderNoSongs=Random Song Play: No songs were found in your OutFox install folder! Switching back to fallback music. You can see on this image and on your file that every line has a Title=Value, and that\u0026rsquo;s how translation works on OutFox, you need to translate the value of the titles and you\u0026rsquo;re done. The theme does all the work of what string it should use.\nNow, you can\u0026rsquo;t just translate literally everything that you see. On ModelLoadError for example there\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;%s\u0026rdquo; that means the theme or the game will put a string replacing that %s.\nAn example of that can be seen on the string %d Song Played that you\u0026rsquo;ll see on the next image.\n[Screen] HelpText=\u0026amp;BACK; Exit \u0026amp;START; Select \u0026amp;SELECT; Options \u0026amp;MENULEFT;\u0026amp;MENURIGHT;\u0026amp;MENUUP;\u0026amp;MENUDOWN; Move [ScreenWithMenuElements] HelpText=\u0026amp;BACK; Exit \u0026amp;START; Select \u0026amp;MENULEFT;\u0026amp;MENURIGHT; Move StageCounter=%s Stage EventStageCounter=Song %i You\u0026rsquo;ll also see lines like \u0026amp;START;, \u0026amp;SELECT; etc. They\u0026rsquo;re buttons that will be replaced once the game draws that string. Let\u0026rsquo;s see one of those strings in action?\n[ScreenSelectProfile] SingularSongPlayed=%d Song Played SeveralSongsPlayed=%d Songs Played PressStart=Press \u0026amp;START; to join. Here we can see that \u0026amp;START; gets replaced by a green square that represents the start button, and %d gets replace by a number that\u0026rsquo;s how many songs that profile played.\nAnother special string is \\n. It creates a line break. For example, First Line\\nSecondLine would result in:\nFirst Line\nSecond Line\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a example in action from _fallback/en.ini:\nText Context    You might also want to translate the theme in a way that someone who has never played before will understand it, instead of expecting everyone to already know what everything is. A new player might not understand what \u0026ldquo;holds\u0026rdquo; mean if that word is translated to your language, but if it was kept as \u0026ldquo;holds\u0026rdquo; the user would know that it\u0026rsquo;s the literal name of the thing and not something that should make sense in your language.\nAnother hard example are steps: in OutFox, there are 2 kinds of steps. The ones that you press in gameplay and the steps of the chart made by the author (easy steps, hard steps\u0026hellip;). In English, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to only say steps because it makes sense for both, but that isn\u0026rsquo;t the case with every language. That\u0026rsquo;s why it was decided to keep it named \u0026ldquo;steps\u0026rdquo; for the pt-BR translation of Soundwaves, for example.\nCommunity Translations for Soundwaves (OutFox default until Alpha V)    Many folks are already helping translate the new Soundwaves theme for various languages. As requested by one of our translators, we\u0026rsquo;ll mention those projects below in order to give them some visibility and encourage more people to join and help.\n° Polish - Done by Moneko\n° Japanese - Done by はぬべき(hanubeki)\n° Portuguese-Brazilian - Done by zerinho6, SHRMP0 and SheepyChris\n° German - Done by DanielRotwind\n° Hebrew - Done by Snil4\n° French - Done by Ksempac and Kaede573\n° Español - Done by JoseVarelaP\n° Hungarian - Done by KaZo75\n° Italian - Done by Gabrimax\n Tools and Practices    Translating can be boring and tedious. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s hard to locate \u0026amp; remove lines that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be there or find missing ones. Because of that, translators themselves create tools to make our job easier and faster.\nTranslation Toolkit    Translation Toolkit is a tool made by Ksempac to help remove lines that are not needed anymore, warn about lines that are missing, check your progress, etc. It supports linux, Mac and Windows.\n This project is intended as a small application to automate some tasks for translators.\nIt is able to parse, analyze and fix the OutFox translation files.\n Stepmania-TranslatorViewMaker    Stepmania-TranslatorViewMaker is a tool made by Snil4. It supports any OS that has python 3 installed.\n Have you ever tried to translate a program like OutFox and wondered \u0026ldquo;Hmm, now where can I find that line in the .ini?\u0026rdquo; Now there\u0026rsquo;s no need to wonder! This program will make a translator view file for your translation .ini and make you translation job easier.\n Tiny-Webini    Tiny-Webini is a tool made by zerinho6 to help with translations of OutFox Website. While not used to translate OutFox (unless themes adopt HTML in the future), it uses the same translation system as OutFox. It makes less HTML code or none at all being necessary to translate the website. While the souce code might be able to run on other OS by building manually, it only supports Windows officially.\n Translate OutFox website with the same style OutFox uses for its translations.\n Best practices    Be constant with your words    When doing a mention to \u0026ldquo;Steps\u0026rdquo;, ask yourself: is it clear which \u0026ldquo;type of Steps\u0026rdquo; you\u0026rsquo;re referring to? We have the following \u0026ldquo;types of steps\u0026rdquo;:\n Steps, which means the notes inside of the chart or the note count. StepDifficulty, which means the difficulty selected of the chart, such as Novice, Expert, Hard. Step, which means the action of stepping in the pad or a single note. StepType, which means the quantization (timing/color) of the note (e.g. 4th = red, an entire beat; 8th = blue, half a beat; etc).  Soundwaves does not have this issue as it says \u0026ldquo;Taps\u0026rdquo; instead of Steps and directly says the difficulty.\nReload translations    Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re editing the Soundwaves ScreenCaution and want to see how the translated string looks. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to restart the entire game to see the changes, here\u0026rsquo;s what you should do instead: Exit the screen you just translated, reload the metrics (Shift + Insert; or Shift + F2 on older alpha versions) and enter the screen again.\nSome themes might have a problem where not all strings are updated when metrics are reloaded due to how they are made. In that case, unfortunately the only option is restart the game.\n OutFox Releases    Now that you have translated the latest alpha, you need to send it to OutFox somehow. This tutorial explains how you can do it!\nThe first thing to keep in mind is that each OutFox translation is hosted inside Tiny-Foxes to easily maintain and keep track of updates, so contact Team Rizu through any of their available social media profiles to get invited into Tiny-Foxes.\nIt is also required to know how git and Github works.\nExact steps are:\n Create a Github account Download and learn basic git commands such as (git status, git push, git pull, git commit and git checkout) Learn how github organization works.  Having an editor such as Visual Studio Code will make git interactions way easier as those commands are available by the interface.\nRepository    OutFox translation repositories adhere to a standard style. Repository title should be:\n\u0026ldquo;OutFox-[languageFileName[-COUNTRY]]\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026quot;-COUNTRY\u0026quot; should only be added in special cases (example: there\u0026rsquo;s Portuguese from Portugal and Brazilian Portuguese, so the Portuguese-Brazilian language file is \u0026ldquo;pt-BR.ini\u0026rdquo;).\nThe description of the repository should be:\n\u0026ldquo;[Language Name] ([languageFileName]) Translation for Project OutFox\u0026rdquo;\u0026quot;\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example:\nOutFox-ja Japanese (ja) Translation for Project OutFox Repository Format    The repository should have 2 folders: \u0026ldquo;_fallback\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo;. Inside the _fallback will be the _fallback translation and default translation inside the default folder.\nOnly the translation file is required to be inside the folders/repository.\nKeep track    It\u0026rsquo;s recommended that you include the version that the translation is targeting inside the files. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n# Version: 4.9.7 Alpha [Common] WindowTitle=Project OutFox StepMania=OutFox Submitting to OutFox    So you finished the translation for this alpha before the release? You can then commit directly to master OR make a Pull Request with your files to OutFox-Translations so Jose_Varela includes them in the next alpha release.\nThis all assumes that you\u0026rsquo;re already a member of Tiny-Foxes and the translator team.\nWebmasters Project    Webmasters is an internal OutFox initiative to translate OutFox Website. Being a webmaster means:\n Partial access to the website backend to implement your translation files; Closer contact with the OutFox Commmunity team for quick updates and help; Having a special role in our Discord Server.  The requirements to join Webmasters are having previous experience as a long-term OutFox translator, being a Discord Server member, and receiving a special invitation from the OutFox Team.\nIf you meet those requirements, there are already tools to help you:\n  OutFoxWeb\nConstantly updated to represent elements that are possible to be translated in the website. Translating those files would result in translating 80% what is possible to translate in the website already.\n  Tiny-Webini\nA tool created by zerinho6 to make website translation faster, easier, better and more like OutFox. Tiny-Webini removes all need to editing HTML files and uses a single .ini file like OutFox instead, it also has translator tools such as: show what can be translated by highlighting translatable elements, changing all translatable text to show its string key instead of string value and generate the HTML files needed to apply on the website backend.\n  "},{"id":37,"href":"/categories/","title":"Categories","parent":"Project OutFox Wiki","content":""},{"id":38,"href":"/user-guide/config/folders/","title":"Content folders","parent":"Features \u0026 Config","content":"Project OutFox uses various folders to store content, such as songs, save data, themes, noteskins, etc. Content is stored in one of the three following locations;\n Global folders are located within the Project OutFox installation directory. If you are on a multi-user operating system, content in these folders will be accessible to all users. When Portable Mode is enabled, your save data (including profiles and preference files) will be placed in the installation directory. User folders are also created in your operating system\u0026rsquo;s home/user directory if Portable Mode is disabled. When Portable Mode is disabled, this is where your save data will be stored.  On macOS, these folders are located in ~/Library/Preferences/StepMania 5.3/ On Linux, these folders are located in ~/.stepmania-5.3/ On Windows, these folders are located in %APPDATA%\\StepMania 5.3   Additional folders are paths configured in the Preferences.ini file; for instance, you can store your song library on a second hard drive and link to it there, or share content between multiple installations.  These content folders comprise the game\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Virtual File System\u0026rdquo; (VFS). They are, in turn, divided into various subdirectories for storing specific types of content.\nAnnouncers    Announcers are a collection of audio files that play automatically based on specific triggers, such as in-game events or navigating to specific screens.\nAppearance    Avatars    Square images that can be used as avatars for your profile.\nJudgments    If supported by the current theme, you can pick a different design for in-game judgement displays from images in this folder.\nJudgement fonts are divided into equally-sized sprites for each judgement. Fonts designed for specific timing modes have a modifier in their file name, such as [Advanced], [FAPlus], etc. A judgement font can also have specific versions for early and late timings.\nNoteSkins    NoteSkins affect the appearance of notes. They could be arrows, bars, circles, pawprints, etc. Project OutFox is compatible with noteskins designed for StepMania 5.\nThe NoteSkins folder is divided into subfolders for specific game types. A global noteskin appears in all game types.\nNoteSkins │ └───dance │ │ │ └───metal │ │NoteSkin.lua │ │... Themes    Themes determine the look, feel, and functionality of the game.\nThemes │ └───My Theme │ │ Metrics.ini │ │ ... Toasties    Inspired by the famous Mortal Kombat easter egg, a toasty is an image and sound played on specific combo milestones.\nBackgroundEffects    Visual effects used for background script sequences in songs.\nBackgroundTransitions    Visual effects used for background script sequences in songs.\nBGAnimations    Actor-based animations that can be played in the background in-game. They can also be used as part of background script sequences in songs.\nCache    The cache generated by Project OutFox when loading songs. Delete this folder to force the game to reload all songs.\nCharacters    3D character models that can be displayed in-game.\nCourses    Playlists of songs used in course modes (such as Extended).\nLogs    When Project OutFox is running, it generates various log files to record diagnostic information and errors. If you are having issues with the game, the log file is a good place to begin.\nRandomMovies    Video clips that can be played in the background in-game. They can also be used as part of background script sequences in songs.\nSave    This is where data such as preferences, profiles, high scores, etc. are stored. If portable mode is enabled, the game will load the Save folder from your installation directory. It is otherwise located in your user folders.\nScreenshots    Screenshots taken in-game are stored here.\nSongMovies    Similar in use to RandomMovies, except that they will be excluded from the RandomMovies pool.\nSongs    Songs that are used to play the game. They are stored in folders known as Groups.\nSongs │ └───My Group │ │ │ └───My Song │ │ mysong.ssc │ │ mysong.ogg │ │ mysong-bg.png │ │ mysong-bn.png │ │ mysong-jk.png Additional folders    Via the preferences file (Save/Preferences.ini), you can specify additional folders.\nBoth of these parameters accept multiple directory paths, comma-separated.\nAdditionalSongFolders    The AdditionalSongFolders option allows you to specify other locations for where Project OutFox can search for songs. As with the installation directory\u0026rsquo;s song folder, they are divided into groups. For example (assuming a location such as D:\\AdditionalSongs);\nD:\\AdditionalSongs │ └───My Group │ │ │ └───My Song │ │ mysong.ssc │ │ mysong.ogg │ │ mysong-bg.png │ │ mysong-bn.png │ │ mysong-jk.png AdditionalFolders    AdditionalFolders is like the above, except they can contain any of the usual content subdirectories like so;\nD:\\OutFoxExtra │ └───Announcers │ └───Appearance │ └───etc. "},{"id":39,"href":"/dev/actors/","title":"Lua and Actors","parent":"Developers and Creators","content":"StepMania (and it\u0026rsquo;s many forks) use what\u0026rsquo;s known as the Actor model. OutFox inherits this behaviour. Everything in the engine is an Actor at its' very core.\nBecause everything is an actor, there are many types of actors, which are described below. Not everything listed is able to be created in Lua. Those that aren\u0026rsquo;t will be noted as such. However, all of these can be found in the Lua environment.\nA note on LoadActor()    This is a helper function that can be used to dynamically load an actor based on the file type. However, this should not be used as it is more resource intensive and can be easily avoided when the filetype is known. For loading external lua files, loadfile(path)() can be used, though the full path is required.\nActor    This is the base that everything derives from. Whatever an Actor can do, everything else can as well. It can be useful for creating control variables without creating something visible on screen.\nExample:\n-- Actors can be very useful as variable controllers since it does not perform any kind of -- overhead to the draw pipe. local Value = 2 Def.Actor{ InitCommand=function(self) Value = Value + 2 Trace(\u0026#34;My Value is now \u0026#34;.. Value) end } ActorFrame    An Actor that can contain one or more Actors. Think of it as a box that can hold as many objects as it can.\nExample:\nDef.ActorFrame{ -- This sprite is now included inside of the ActorFrame. -- Any changes from the ActorFrame will affect the sprite, such as position, rotation, -- zoom and such. Def.Sprite{} } ActorFrameTexture    It\u0026rsquo;s like an ActorFrame, but instead of displaying what\u0026rsquo;s inside onto the screen, it places the contents of the ActorFrame onto a Texture that a Sprite (or any other actor that can load textures) can read from.\nPopularized by its' use in NotITG, although the behavior is different. NotITG\u0026rsquo;s version places the screen itself onto a texture instead of what\u0026rsquo;s inside the ActorFrame and requires basezoom to be used on sprites to make the image fit inside the game window.\nExample:\n--[[ This example will create an ActorFrameTexture that uses a sample BitmapText, and project it to the center to the screen in half of the available size of the viewport window. ]] -- This ActorFrame will contain everything. local t = Def.ActorFrame{} -- First, create the ActorFrameTexture. local AFT = Def.ActorFrameTexture{ InitCommand = function(self) -- Start by adding a name to the texture.

What shows depends on what the simfile sets for the display BPM.\nUsually used as part of ScreenSelectMusic.\nComboGraph    Shows the combos that were held throughout the song, with combo breaks separating the blocks, and the largest combo being colored.\nDef.ComboGraph{ InitCommand=function(self) -- Load the MetricsGroup that will create the basis for the graph. self:Load(\u0026#34;ComboGraph\u0026#34;) local playerStageStats = STATSMAN:GetCurStageStats():GetPlayerStageStats(player) local stageStats = STATSMAN:GetCurStageStats() -- Data is graph from the current stage stats and the player\u0026#39;s stats. self:Set(stageStats, playerStageStats) end } ControllerStateDisplay    Appears to show the status of controllers/pads.\nCourseContentsList    A list of the songs for a given course. Can be given a limit for how many songs to show and how many to show at a time.\nDeviceList    Displays a list of all input devices. Often, Keyboard and Mouse will be listed.\nFunctions like most other BitmapText actors.\nDifficultyIcon    A Sprite-type actor that shows a different icon for each difficulty.\nIf there number of frames are double the amount of difficulties available in the engine, the player number will offset the icon shown.\nDynamicActorScroller    Inherits from ActorScroller, uses only one child Actor to draw all items.\nFadingBanner    A song or course banner that can fade between the banner for different songs or courses.\nOften seen in ScreenSelectMusic.\nGradeDisplay    Shows the grade a player has gotten for a given song\u0026rsquo;s chart.\nGraphDisplay    Displays a graph containing data points for a player\u0026rsquo;s life throughout the stage.\nSettings for a GraphDisplay can only be defined through metrics.\nDef.GraphDisplay{ InitCommand=function(self) -- Load the MetricsGroup that will create the basis for the graph. self:Load(\u0026#34;GraphDisplay\u0026#34;) local playerStageStats = STATSMAN:GetCurStageStats():GetPlayerStageStats(player) local stageStats = STATSMAN:GetCurStageStats() -- Data is graph from the current stage stats and the player\u0026#39;s stats. self:Set(stageStats, playerStageStats) end } GrooveRadar    A recreation of the five-point \u0026ldquo;Groove Radar\u0026rdquo; from DDR. Can take arbitrary values as well as the song\u0026rsquo;s radar values.\nHelpDisplay    A BitmapText-type actor that allows for cycling automatically through tips.\nDef.HelpDisplay { File=\u0026#34;Common Normal\u0026#34;, InitCommand=function(self) local s = \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; .. \u0026#34;::\u0026#34; .. \u0026#34;This is a new line\u0026#34; .. \u0026#34;::\u0026#34; .. \u0026#34;And another one!\u0026#34; -- We\u0026#39;ll set the next to toggle between each line (Separated by double colons) by 0.5 seconds. self:SetSecsBetweenSwitches(0.5) -- And tell the HelpDisplay to show that text. :SetTipsColonSeparated(s) end } HoldJudgment    Often found in Player, though there is no way to grab the ones that are in Player.\nThe judgment that shows up on a column when dropping or clearing a hold \u0026amp; roll.\nThere is an extra function to allow tracking the hold judgments from a MultiPlayer.\nInputList    Displays a list of inputs as they occur. Can show unmapped and mapped inputs.\nFunctions like most other BitmapText actors.\nLogDisplay    This is an actor type created from _fallback\u0026rsquo;s scripts.\nDisplays lua script errors as they happen. Most themers shouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to touch this.\nLifeMeter    Cannot be created from lua, but can be grabbed from ScreenGameplay.\nOften used in gameplay screens. This shows how much life a Player currently has.\nLifeMeterBattery    Cannot be created from lua.\nOften used in gameplay screens. This shows how many more mistakes a player is allowed before failing.\nMemoryCardDisplay    Shows the current state of a player\u0026rsquo;s inserted memory card. Made of images, with one for each state.\nMenuTimer    Cannot be created from lua, but is a part of every screen that inherits from ScreenWithMenuElements.\nA Timer that counts down and proceeds to the next screen when it reaches 0.\nMeterDisplay    Shows the current progress of an operation. It appears to only show the progress as 50%.\nModel    Allows one to display MilkShape3D ASCII models, having separate attributes for materials, bones and meshes.\nDef.Model{ Meshes=\u0026#34;MyModel.txt\u0026#34;, Materials=\u0026#34;MyModel.txt\u0026#34;, Bones=\u0026#34;MyModel.txt\u0026#34;, OnCommand=function(self) self:Center() -- When a model begins its animation, it will loop indefinitely. To stop that, use the loop command to -- set the flag to false. self:loop(false) end } Meshes are the composition and structure of the Model. This data represents the vertices that make the Model take shape.\nMaterials are the textures that the model will use. These can be any of the image formats listed in the Supported File Extensions page. They can also be .ini files that define animated textures on a Def.Sprite.\nBones make the model come to life. They can be defined within the primary model file, or, in the case of dancing characters, be controlled via a separate file that only contains the bones.\nIn the above example, all three attributes used the same filepath; all the necessary data was contained within a single file. It is possible to configure the MilkShape 3D software to output distinct files for meshes, materials, and bones, and set each Def.Model attribute accordingly, but that is outside the scope of this lesson.\nNOTE: All three attributes must be provided within Def.Model as paths to resources that can be loaded or the game will crash.\nWith OutFox, you can store several types of animations on the same model and call them at any moment.\n-- Let\u0026#39;s load a animation called WarmUp, located on a file called \u0026#34;Warm1.txt\u0026#34;. self:LoadBones( \u0026#34;WarmUp\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Warm1.txt\u0026#34; ) -- Now the model has an animation called \u0026#34;WarmUp\u0026#34;, and can be called at any time with playanimation. -- The second value is optional, and sets the rate of the animation\u0026#39;s speed. self:playanimation( \u0026#34;WarmUp\u0026#34;, 1 ) ModIconRow    Shows icons for the currently set modifiers of a player.\nNot all modifiers have an icon, and the settings can only be set through metrics.\nMusicWheel    Cannot be created from lua, but can be grabbed from the TopScreen.\nThe wheel used to select songs in ScreenSelectMusic or courses in ScreenSelectCourse.\nNoteColumnRenderer    Cannot be created from lua, but can be grabbed from NoteField.\nThis is a dedicated actor for a column in the notefield, and can be treated like any other actor.\nNoteField    Cannot be created from lua, but resides in Player.\nContains the receptors and notes as seen in gameplay.\nOptionRow    Cannot be created from lua.\nOften seen in options screens, this actor allows for picking and choosing various options for a given setting.\nPaneDisplay    Shows the number of steps, jumps, holds, rolls, mines, hands, lifts, fakes, the machine profile\u0026rsquo;s highscore \u0026amp; name and the current profile\u0026rsquo;s high score for a given chart.\nSettings must be defined through Metrics.\nPercentageDisplay    Shows a player\u0026rsquo;s current percentage (Actual DancePoints divided by Possible DancePoints).\nPlayer    Cannot be created from lua, but is part of ScreenGameplay\nThe entirety of the playfield. Holds the judgment, hold judgments, combo and the NoteField.\nQuad    An arbitrary rectangle. Acts like a Sprite with a blank texture.\n-- Generate a 64 x 64 rectangle on the center of the screen, and color it Yellow. Def.Quad{ OnCommand=function(self) self:zoomto( 64,64 ):diffuse( Color.Yellow ) :xy( SCREEN_CENTER_X, SCREEN_CENTER_Y ) end } RollingNumbers    A BitmapText with a number that transitions to the target number.\nRequires metrics for it to be loaded before anything else is done with it.\nDef.RollingNumbers{ -- Load the font that the numbers will be rendered with. File = THEME:GetPathF(\u0026#34;Common\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Normal\u0026#34;), InitCommand=function(self) -- Loads the MetricsGroup to use it\u0026#39;s settings on. self:Load(\u0026#34;RollingNumbers\u0026#34;) -- To update the value, use the targetnumber function. self:targetnumber(300) end } ScoreDisplayAliveTime    A BitmapText-type actor that shows how long a player has survived through the stage.\nScoreDisplayCalories    A RollingNumbers-type actor that shows how many calories a player has burned through the stage.\nScreen    Can\u0026rsquo;t be defined in lua, but can be defined in a theme\u0026rsquo;s metrics.\nA screen the theme can go to. There are screens for gameplay, selecting music, pre-gameplay, etc. Each screen has a background, underlay, overlay and decorations that can be used.\nSongBPMDisplay    Shows the current BPM during gameplay. Does not appear to take split timing into account.\nSongMeterDisplay    A MeterDisplay that shows the current position of the song being played.\nDef.SongMeterDisplay{ InitCommand=function(self) -- This generates a 300 x [the height of your Stream texture] that will define the current progress of whatever song is currently being played. -- The actor will automatically update progress for the Tip and the Stream. self:SetStreamWidth( 300 ) end, -- Both the Stream and Tip are AutoActors, so they can be any actor type. Stream=Def.Sprite{ Texture=\u0026#34;MyStreamBar\u0026#34; }, Tip=Def.Sprite{ Texture=\u0026#34;MyTip\u0026#34; } } Sound    Used to play sound files outside of the common theme sound effects and the simfile\u0026rsquo;s song itself.\nRemoves the need to use SOUND:PlayOnce(), as it allows for pre-loading the sound file at the start instead of loading (possibly many times) and playing the sound mid-screen.\nDef.Sound{ -- Load the audio called MySound, which is a ogg file in this example. File=\u0026#34;MySound.ogg\u0026#34;, -- Lets the audio pane from side to side. Useful for audios that need to play on a specific player side. SupportPan=true, -- Allows the audio to change rate and pitch. SupportRateChanging=false, -- this assigns the audio to be an Action, which is a flag for sounds that allows it to be muted by the player, -- with the use of the Mute Actions key (Default to \u0026#34;Pause\u0026#34;). IsAction=true, OnCommand=function(self) -- When creating the actor, sound will not play automatically, so you need to use the play command -- to perform such action. self:play() -- If the audio has the \u0026#34;(loop)\u0026#34; flag set on its filename, it will loop infinetly. So to top it, use the -- appropiate command. self:stop() -- If the sound needs to be paused on a particular frame, and not to reset, use the pause command. self:pause( true ) -- Use false to resume it. -- To control actions like volume, you need to access the ActorSound\u0026#39;s RageSound, by using the get function. local MyRageSound = self:get() MyRageSound:volume(0.5) -- Changes volume (0 to 1). MyRageSound:pitch( 1.2 ) -- Requires SupportRateChanging to work. MyRageSound:speed( 1.4 ) -- Requires SupportRateChanging to work. end } Sprite    Allows one to display images on screen. These images can be a png, jpeg, gif or even a video file.\nDef.Sprite{ Texture=\u0026#34;MyTexture.png\u0026#34;, -- The Texture is optional, you can start a sprite without a texture. -- You can manipulate the ammount of frames that a sprite can use using the Sprite argument. Frames={ -- The structure for the Frame is as follows: --{ Frame = int, Delay = float , {float,float}, {float,float} } -- The two tables are optional upper left and lower right corners of the fraction of the -- frame to use. -- This will make a 4 frame sprite toggle between its frames for 0.5 seconds, -- making a 2 second animation. { Frame = 0, Delay = 0.5 }, { Frame = 1, Delay = 0.5 }, { Frame = 2, Delay = 0.5 }, { Frame = 3, Delay = 0.5 }, }, OnCommand=function(self) -- You can also load new textures after assigning one beforehand. -- The path in Load is absolute, so you must put the entire path to the new image. self:Load( --[[ [Path to another texture] ]] ) -- You can pause or jump to other sprites with the following commands. self:animate(0) -- 0 pauses the animation, 1 resumes it (Can be used as well for Models). self:pause() -- An alias for animate(0) (Can be used as well for Models). self:play() -- An alias for animate(1) (Can be used as well for Models). -- setstate jumps to a frame of the animation assigned. Animation states are 0-indexed. self:setstate( 2 ) -- Jumps to the third frame of the animation. -- If an out-of-range value is assigned ( \u0026lt; 0 or \u0026gt; #Frames ), an error is displayed -- displaying the total ammount of frames available on the current sprite. -- The Frames set can also be manipulated during runtime, by using the SetStateProperties -- function. This example now inverts the animation. self:SetStateProperties( { { Frame = 3, Delay = 0.5 }, { Frame = 2, Delay = 0.5 }, { Frame = 1, Delay = 0.5 }, { Frame = 0, Delay = 0.5 }, } ) end } StepsDisplay    Displays the data for a given chart. Can show difficulty number, description, credit, if it\u0026rsquo;s autogen and steps type.\nCurrently, all setings are done through metrics.\nStepsDisplayList    Shows the list of steps available for a given song.\nThe name given determines what metrics group to load from.\nDef.StepsDisplayList { Name=\u0026#34;StepsDisplayList\u0026#34;, -- These define the cursor the players will be controlling. The rest of the elements are defined -- by the metrics. CursorP1=Def.Actor{}, CursorP2=Def.Actor{}, CursorP1Frame=Def.Actor{}, CursorP2Frame=Def.Actor{} } TextBanner    A \u0026ldquo;Banner\u0026rdquo; that contains the song name, artist and subtitle.\nUsually seen in the CourseContentsList of ScreenSelectMusic or the ScrollerItem in ScreenHighScores.\nWheelBase    Cannot be created from lua.\nA base class for wheels. Currently, the MusicWheel and RoomWheel inherit from this.\nWheelItemBase    Cannot be created from lua.\nA base class for items residing in wheels.
