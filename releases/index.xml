The Alpha of many changes&amp;hellip; Introducing Both At Once! What is Both At Once? Both at once is a popular feature option used in @taronuke&amp;rsquo;s project Not in the Groove. It allows player one to input to player two, while playing mod files. As many of the mod files ported from NitG require two joined players, and before this alpha, the method to enable autoplay for the alternate player was a bit sketchy on SM5, we have taken the time to add this feature to OutFox.</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 4.9.1 Build</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.9.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.9.1/</guid><description>Release Date: 31st October 2020 &amp;ldquo;Spooky Scary Bugs&amp;rdquo; Turn smoothlines off to get a better play experience if your lines are being drawn thickly!
