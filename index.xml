The Alpha of many changes&amp;hellip; Introducing Both At Once! What is Both At Once? Both at once is a popular feature option used in @taronuke&amp;rsquo;s project Not in the Groove. It allows player one to input to player two, while playing mod files. As many of the mod files ported from NitG require two joined players, and before this alpha, the method to enable autoplay for the alternate player was a bit sketchy on SM5, we have taken the time to add this feature to OutFox.</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 4.9.1 Build</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.9.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.9.1/</guid><description>Release Date: 31st October 2020 &amp;ldquo;Spooky Scary Bugs&amp;rdquo; Turn smoothlines off to get a better play experience if your lines are being drawn thickly!

Some modifiers can be selected through the options menu before starting a song, but there are also simfiles with scripted modifiers that tend to have a wildly different experience than just a regular simfile. (Generally, they&amp;rsquo;re known as &amp;ldquo;modfiles&amp;rdquo;)
General notes Often, modifiers (or &amp;ldquo;mods&amp;rdquo;) have what&amp;rsquo;s called an &amp;ldquo;approach rate&amp;rdquo;, which is how fast it&amp;rsquo;ll go to reach the specified value.</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 4.5.9 Build</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.5.9/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.5.9/</guid><description>Release Date: 14th June 2020 All platforms Fix OpenGL context math overflow edge crash Fix math overflow in arroweffects Added math speedups in notedisplay Fix wayward frame counting on pump and para Added new math functions for 2 dimensional actors 🐲 Removed RageVector2 from the game 🐲 Added new catch all to move users on &amp;lt;= GL 2.0 to the OpenGL Renderer 🐲 Fixed Texture Size overflow Fixed Sprite Overflow causing edge crash (Thanks HeySora!</description></item><item><title>Speed</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-1-Speed-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-1-Speed-Mods/</guid><description>These modifiers are used to control the scroll speed of notes in gameplay. These modifiers are not column-specific, unlike later mods described elsewhere.
Negative speed modifiers cannot be selected from the Player Options menu, nor can it be set through the lua functions PlayerOptions provides, but it can become negative through the use of mod strings (and some modfiles have taken advantage of that).
XMod Desc: The &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; in &amp;ldquo;XMod&amp;rdquo; is for multiply, with it often showing as 1x or 2.</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 4.5.8 Build</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.5.8/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.5.8/</guid><description>Release Date: 31st May 2020 This is a QoL update.

Scripted modfiles can use these to do effects like rocking the notefield back and forth among other effects (And is definitely noticable with 3D noteskins).
Unlike most modifiers available through PlayerOptions, these functions only return values in terms of tilt and skew and don&amp;rsquo;t return the current/previous approach rate. Perspecitve modifiers aren&amp;rsquo;t column-specific either.
Hallway Desc: The notefield is tilted away from the player, so that notes start far away and come closer.</description></item><item><title>Column movement</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-3-Column-Movement-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-3-Column-Movement-Mods/</guid><description>Column movement modifiers allow one to move the columns in any direction. Usually, these are used to create &amp;ldquo;column swaps&amp;rdquo;, which alter the visual order of the columns in gameplay.
Flip Desc: Flip alters the column order to make it appear backwards. For Example, if the column order is usually left down up right, the order becomes right up down left.
Negative values have been used to space out the columns, so values from -200% to 100% could be possible.</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 4.5.6 Build</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.5.6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.5.6/</guid><description> Release Date: 8th May 2020 All platforms Aligned inline sine math with NotITG.

This is often used to change from upscroll to downscroll among other effects.
Reverse Desc: Reverse flips the scroll of the whole notefield from upscroll to downscroll. There is also a column-specific version that adds onto the value of normal Reverse.
Commonly, 50% or 100% is used on its&amp;rsquo; own.
Quirks: When going over 100%, the effect goes backwards, with 200% being normal upscroll again.</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 4.4 Build</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.4/</guid><description>Release Date: 4th March 2020 Alpha 4.4.1 changes Properly removed the obsolete input handlers - seems there was a separate one added to a lone screen. Cheers, Glenn. Fixed missing keystrokes on profile creation and high score name entry.

Some noteskins may affect how the effect looks due to how rotation and zoom interact in the notefield.
OutFox and Open/NotITG act the same way, while earlier versions of SM5 may act differently.
Dizzy Desc: Notes spin as they reach the receptor, with more rotationz added the farther away from the receptor a note is.</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 4.3 Build</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.3/</guid><description>Release Date: 9th February 2020 All platforms Fixed various missing keyboard inputs, including symbol keys (;:&amp;rsquo;@#,&amp;lt;&amp;gt;./?|`{}[])(&amp;amp;^%$&amp;quot;), the ~ key for localised keyboards, and the number pad. Fixed missing options for no mapping on localised keyboards. 🐲 Add touchscreen and mouse input hooks 🐲 Added hooks for haptic/rumble support on controllers. Why? Why not? 🐲 Fixed odd skipping on inputfilters. Removed average FPS gauge from debug overlay; caused skew on mod files.</description></item><item><title>Zoom</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-6-Zoom-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-6-Zoom-Mods/</guid><description>Zoom modifiers affect the size of the notefield or notes &amp;amp; receptors. Zoom works a bit differently in SM5 in that it also affects the z axis unlike in ITG/SM3.95, which only affect x &amp;amp; y.
Extra scaling may be required if recreating effects between ITG and SM5.
Mods that work on the note and column-level may make holds look a bit weird due to how hold scaling works.
Mini Desc: Mini scales down the entire notefield, while maintaining the receptor position.</description></item><item><title>Acceleration</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-7-Acceleration-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-7-Acceleration-Mods/</guid><description>Acceleration modifiers mess with the vertical acceleration of the note. It lets people have notes speed up, slow down, or do a 180 among other things.
Boomerang Desc: Notes start flying out from the top of the screen, do a 180 at around the bottom of the screen, and go back towards the receptors.
The modifier has a simple on/off nature, so any nonzero magnitude will work. (Unless the VariableBoomerang sub modifier is in play)</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 4.2 Build</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.2/</guid><description>Release Date: 5th February 2020 Windows build was pulled due to bugs.

Cover Desc: Cover hides the song background. The range between fully lit and fully hidden scales based on the current value of the BGBrightness preference.
Use negative amounts to bring back the background if BGBrightness is less than 1. A lot of modfiles use large amounts of negative cover to deal with any positive value BGBrightness could have.</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 3.0 to 4.0 Roadmap</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/roadmap/2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/roadmap/2019/</guid><description>OutFox Alpha 3.0 to 4.0 Roadmap The following list is what the project planned and needed to have ready in time for our first public Alpha build that was released on the 16th December 2019.

Drunk Desc: Drunk makes the notes and receptors move left and right in a constantly shifting sinusoidal wave. There are extra variants for the Y and Z axis, as well as tangent variants.
Common values can be practically any value, due to its&amp;rsquo; wide use in modfiles.</description></item><item><title>About Project OutFox</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/meta/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/meta/about/</guid><description>What is Project OutFox? Project OutFox is a fork of StepMania 5.1. The project began to improve the main repo and it&amp;rsquo;s codebase, however due to community feedback and response the project changed direction into what it is today; A working museum of scrolling rhythm games playable within a single client.
The team provides a free-to-play cross-platform engine supporting and supported by the many new communities and areas that OutFox now supports.</description></item><item><title>BMS/BME/PMS Support</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mode-support/bms-pms-support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mode-support/bms-pms-support/</guid><description>Project OutFox contains parsers for the BMS and PMS chart formats, which are the standard formats used in conjunction with mostly the be-mu and po-mu game types.

A lot of these follow similar behaviors to the Visibility modifiers, alongside with some extra functionalities.
&amp;lt;color&amp;gt; can be 'ColorType_Red', 'ColorType_Blue' or 'ColorType_Green', and is how one chooses the color channel to affect.
These modifiers generally share usable values between 0 to 100%.
StealthColor Desc: Bring a color channel of the notes down to zero (This does not affect the actual glow color).</description></item><item><title>DTX &amp; GDA/G2D Support</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mode-support/dtx-gda-support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mode-support/dtx-gda-support/</guid><description>Preview shot of this mode from Alpha 4.9.8 with fallback theme Project OutFox contains parsers for the DTX and GDA/G2D chart formats, which are the standard formats used in conjunction with the gddm and gdgf game types.

Sprites that use a video file do not apply for this guide, as the sprite only recognizes it as a single frame, given it&amp;rsquo;s now using FFMpeg to handle playback of said video. For this, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to obtain the Sprite&amp;rsquo;s RageTexture and use the position function, which handles its value in seconds.</description></item><item><title>Obtaining Childs and ActorFrame Levels</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/actortypes/actor/obtainlevels/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/actortypes/actor/obtainlevels/</guid><description>When using Actors, you can use self:GetParent() and self:GetChild() to get elements from other ActorFrames or actors. self:GetChild() can only be used by ActorFrames.

About History: This mode started life as a notes loader for obscure dance charts created in 1998, with 4 key and 6 key being supported. 4k doubles seemed to appear around 2000, before being replaced completely with MSD/DWI around the same time. The loader has been present for a very long time in the games history, not adding actual BMS support until 2003.</description></item><item><title>Game Module: bongo</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/bongo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/bongo/</guid><description>About It parses files made for taitai into a lane mode to play on a bongo based controller, or bongo based midi controller.

We would like to thank Josen Tiamat for writing these new instructions for how to configure your controllers for use on OutFox.</description></item><item><title>Drums Mapping</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/controllers/controller_mapping_drums/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/controllers/controller_mapping_drums/</guid><description> Madcatz Rock Band 4 Drum Kit (Playstation 4, Bluetooth) Madcatz Rock Band 4 Drum Kit (Playstation 4, Bluetooth) Outfox Joypad Button Physical Device Name po-mu Button 1 Blue Pad and Cym Right Yellow Button 2 Green Pad and Cym Right Green Button 3 Red Pad Red Button 4 Yellow Pad and Cym Right Blue Button 5 Right Pedal Button 6 Left Pedal</description></item><item><title>Guitars Mapping</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/controllers/controller_mapping_guitars/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/controllers/controller_mapping_guitars/</guid><description> Madcatz Rock Band 4 Guitar (Playstation 4, Bluetooth) Madcatz Rock Band 4 Guitar (Playstation 4, Bluetooth) Outfox Joypad Button Physical Device Name gh gdgf Button 1 Blue Fret Fret 4 Fret 4 Button 2 Green Fret Fret 1 Fret 1 Button 3 Red Fret Fret 2 Fret 2 Button 4 Yellow Fret Fret 3 Fret 3 Button 5 Orange Fret Fret 5 Fret 5 Button 9 Share Button 10 Options Whammy Button 11 Solo Buttons (Any) H-Up Strum Up Strum Up H-Down Strum Down Strum Down</description></item><item><title>Modifier Files</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/effects/EffectFiles-ModifierFiles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/effects/EffectFiles-ModifierFiles/</guid><description>These simfiles have modifiers that are scripted to happen at various points of the song. The difficulty can range between &amp;ldquo;trivial to read&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;may as well memorize the chart&amp;rdquo;.
Often called &amp;ldquo;Modfiles&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Modcharts&amp;rdquo;.
These usually use the FGCHANGES or BGCHANGES of a simfile to load the lua files (if any are used).
Disclaimer: Make sure you&amp;rsquo;ve got making a chart down before starting to make modcharts! Good mods can&amp;rsquo;t save a bad chart!</description></item><item><title>OutFox Serenity</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/meta/serenity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/meta/serenity/</guid><description>What is OutFox Serenity? OutFox Serenity is the official community song pack project made primarily for Project OutFox. Its purpose is to produce packs of &amp;ldquo;libre&amp;rdquo; songs for the game that can be freely redistributed (including as part of its default, bundled songs), and to showcase the functionality of Project Outfox by offering charts for multiple game types beyond just 4-key/dance.
How was OutFox Serenity created?

You can think of them as images that represent each letter.
We have a BitmapText actor, with a default font (Common Normal) that has the following text:

These are always available to use, from anywhere in the theme. However, it is advised to use these sparingly to avoid unnecesary carry over of data, overlapping variable names with other existing Lua naming scopes, and others.
It is recommended practice to ensure script data is kept to a minimum to avoid collision with objects like song data, scores, player data, mods, profile information, song rates, and others.</description></item><item><title>Translation</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/translation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/translation/</guid><description>Are you translating a theme to another language? Reading this might help you.
Where are language files stored Inside every theme, there&amp;rsquo;ll be a Languages folder. Inside that folder is where language files are stored. Example:
Languages/ en.ini ja.ini Here we can see 2 language files: en for English and ja for Japanese. It&amp;rsquo;s a standard to name language files in that format (language-COUNTRY.ini). For example: In this case, there&amp;rsquo;s a Portuguese translation, but since there&amp;rsquo;s also Portuguese from Portugal, the file was named pt-BR (BR = Brazil).</description></item><item><title>Tweening</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/ActorsLua-Tweening/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/ActorsLua-Tweening/</guid><description>Actors have the ability to transition from point A to point B using Tweening.
It allows for queueing up movements &amp;amp; transitions on position, size, color and other attributes as well as commands and messages.
Queueing-style tweens These help with queueing actions after a certain amount of time.
Sleep The actor waits for a given amount of seconds before performing the next command.

These can be loaded by using the LoadModule function. Depending on the return methodology from the module, it can be called in several ways.
Given the loading nature of modules, it is not recommended to use LoadModule directly if the function that will load it is called too quickly (like calling the module inside of a JudgmentMessageCommand), specially with modules that require file loading/saving.</description></item><item><title>Sounds</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/theming/Theming-Sounds/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/theming/Theming-Sounds/</guid><description>Your theme can contain sounds, which are either sound effects or music that will play across screens or actions. You can find the difference between these items by looking at their file names. The structure goes as follows:
[The name of the screen] [engine defined action / music / custom set controlled by lua] There are specific elements that are loaded by the engine to perform sound playback, for example, when moving up or down on a options menu, it will grab ScreenOptions prev/next for its sound effects.</description></item><item><title>Converting XML files to Lua</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/Converting-xml-to-Lua/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/Converting-xml-to-Lua/</guid><description>Converting xml files into lua files.
