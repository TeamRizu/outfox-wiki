Some modifiers can be selected through the options menu before starting a song, but there are also simfiles with scripted modifiers that tend to have a wildly different experience than just a regular simfile. (Generally, they&amp;rsquo;re known as &amp;ldquo;modfiles&amp;rdquo;)
General notes Often, modifiers (or &amp;ldquo;mods&amp;rdquo;) have what&amp;rsquo;s called an &amp;ldquo;approach rate&amp;rdquo;, which is how fast it&amp;rsquo;ll go to reach the specified value.</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 4.5.9 Build</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.5.9/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.5.9/</guid><description>Release Date: 14th June 2020 All platforms Fix OpenGL context math overflow edge crash Fix math overflow in arroweffects Added math speedups in notedisplay Fix wayward frame counting on pump and para Added new math functions for 2 dimensional actors üê≤ Removed RageVector2 from the game üê≤ Added new catch all to move users on &amp;lt;= GL 2.0 to the OpenGL Renderer üê≤ Fixed Texture Size overflow Fixed Sprite Overflow causing edge crash (Thanks HeySora!</description></item><item><title>Speed</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-1-Speed-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-1-Speed-Mods/</guid><description>These modifiers are used to control the scroll speed of notes in gameplay. These modifiers are not column-specific, unlike later mods described elsewhere.
Negative speed modifiers cannot be selected from the Player Options menu, nor can it be set through the lua functions PlayerOptions provides, but it can become negative through the use of mod strings (and some modfiles have taken advantage of that).
XMod Desc: The &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; in &amp;ldquo;XMod&amp;rdquo; is for multiply, with it often showing as 1x or 2.</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 4.5.8 Build</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.5.8/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.5.8/</guid><description>Release Date: 31st May 2020 This is a QoL update.

Scripted modfiles can use these to do effects like rocking the notefield back and forth among other effects (And is definitely noticable with 3D noteskins).
Unlike most modifiers available through PlayerOptions, these functions only return values in terms of tilt and skew and don&amp;rsquo;t return the current/previous approach rate. Perspecitve modifiers aren&amp;rsquo;t column-specific either.
Hallway Desc: The notefield is tilted away from the player, so that notes start far away and come closer.</description></item><item><title>Column movement</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-3-Column-Movement-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-3-Column-Movement-Mods/</guid><description>Column movement modifiers allow one to move the columns in any direction. Usually, these are used to create &amp;ldquo;column swaps&amp;rdquo;, which alter the visual order of the columns in gameplay.
Flip Desc: Flip alters the column order to make it appear backwards. For Example, if the column order is usually left down up right, the order becomes right up down left.
Negative values have been used to space out the columns, so values from -200% to 100% could be possible.</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 4.5.6 Build</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.5.6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.5.6/</guid><description>Release Date: 8th May 2020 All platforms Aligned inline sine math with NotITG.

This is often used to change from upscroll to downscroll among other effects.
Reverse Desc: Reverse flips the scroll of the whole notefield from upscroll to downscroll. There is also a column-specific version that adds onto the value of normal Reverse.
Commonly, 50% or 100% is used on its' own.
Quirks: When going over 100%, the effect goes backwards, with 200% being normal upscroll again.</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 4.4 Build</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.4/</guid><description>Release Date: 4th March 2020 Alpha 4.4.1 changes Properly removed the obsolete input handlers - seems there was a separate one added to a lone screen.

Some noteskins may affect how the effect looks due to how rotation and zoom interact in the notefield.
OutFox and Open/NotITG act the same way, while earlier versions of SM5 may act differently.
Dizzy Desc: Notes spin as they reach the receptor, with more rotationz added the farther away from the receptor a note is.</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 4.3 Build</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.3/</guid><description>Release Date: 9th February 2020 All platforms Fixed various missing keyboard inputs, including symbol keys (;:'@#,&amp;lt;&amp;gt;./?|`{}[])(&amp;amp;^%$&amp;quot;), the ~ key for localised keyboards, and the number pad.

Zoom works a bit differently in SM5 in that it also affects the z axis unlike in ITG/SM3.95, which only affect x &amp;amp; y.
Extra scaling may be required if recreating effects between ITG and SM5.
Mods that work on the note and column-level may make holds look a bit weird due to how hold scaling works.
Mini Desc: Mini scales down the entire notefield, while maintaining the receptor position.</description></item><item><title>Acceleration</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-7-Acceleration-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-7-Acceleration-Mods/</guid><description>Acceleration modifiers mess with the vertical acceleration of the note. It lets people have notes speed up, slow down, or do a 180 among other things.
Boomerang Desc: Notes start flying out from the top of the screen, do a 180 at around the bottom of the screen, and go back towards the receptors.
The modifier has a simple on/off nature, so any nonzero magnitude will work. (Unless the VariableBoomerang sub modifier is in play)</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 4.2 Build</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.2/</guid><description>Release Date: 5th February 2020 Windows build was pulled due to bugs.

It is recommended that you do not install it to the Program Files directory, as this is known to cause problems. The installer offers optional components, such as the noteskins that were included with StepMania 5.0.12 and 5.1, and &amp;ldquo;Toasties&amp;rdquo; - animations that can trigger on combo milestones in-game.

This system is based off the spline system used in NotITG, which means it is usable alongside the pre-existing SM5 spline system and other modifiers, too.
Points are positioned like they are for Gradient modifiers, meaning in multiples of ARROW_SIZE away from the receptor.
In SM5, this is only accessible through the PlayerOptions functions, while NotITG has functions available in Player and also has modstring versions available (Though, it&amp;rsquo;s recommended to use the lua functions instead.</description></item><item><title>Anatomy of a Lua actor</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/ActorsLua-Anatomy+Structure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/ActorsLua-Anatomy+Structure/</guid><description>Every actor in SM5 follows a standart general structure, with ActorFrames being more flexible in how they&amp;rsquo;re constructed.
