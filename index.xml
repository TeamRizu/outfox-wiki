The Alpha of many changes&amp;hellip; Introducing Both At Once! What is Both At Once? Both at once is a popular feature option used in @taronuke&amp;rsquo;s project Not in the Groove. It allows player one to input to player two, while playing mod files. As many of the mod files ported from NitG require two joined players, and before this alpha, the method to enable autoplay for the alternate player was a bit sketchy on SM5, we have taken the time to add this feature to OutFox.</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 4.9.1 Build</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.9.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.9.1/</guid><description>Release Date: 31st October 2020 &amp;ldquo;Spooky Scary Bugs&amp;rdquo; Turn smoothlines off to get a better play experience if your lines are being drawn thickly!

Some modifiers can be selected through the options menu before starting a song, but there are also simfiles with scripted modifiers that tend to have a wildly different experience than just a regular simfile. (Generally, they&amp;rsquo;re known as &amp;ldquo;modfiles&amp;rdquo;)
General notes Often, modifiers (or &amp;ldquo;mods&amp;rdquo;) have what&amp;rsquo;s called an &amp;ldquo;approach rate&amp;rdquo;, which is how fast it&amp;rsquo;ll go to reach the specified value.</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 4.5.9 Build</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.5.9/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.5.9/</guid><description>Release Date: 14th June 2020 All platforms Fix OpenGL context math overflow edge crash Fix math overflow in arroweffects Added math speedups in notedisplay Fix wayward frame counting on pump and para Added new math functions for 2 dimensional actors 🐲 Removed RageVector2 from the game 🐲 Added new catch all to move users on &amp;lt;= GL 2.0 to the OpenGL Renderer 🐲 Fixed Texture Size overflow Fixed Sprite Overflow causing edge crash (Thanks HeySora!</description></item><item><title>Speed</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-1-Speed-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-1-Speed-Mods/</guid><description>These modifiers are used to control the scroll speed of notes in gameplay. These modifiers are not column-specific, unlike later mods described elsewhere.
Negative speed modifiers cannot be selected from the Player Options menu, nor can it be set through the lua functions PlayerOptions provides, but it can become negative through the use of mod strings (and some modfiles have taken advantage of that).
XMod Desc: The &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; in &amp;ldquo;XMod&amp;rdquo; is for multiply, with it often showing as 1x or 2.</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 4.5.8 Build</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.5.8/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.5.8/</guid><description>Release Date: 31st May 2020 This is a QoL update.

Scripted modfiles can use these to do effects like rocking the notefield back and forth among other effects (And is definitely noticable with 3D noteskins).
Unlike most modifiers available through PlayerOptions, these functions only return values in terms of tilt and skew and don&amp;rsquo;t return the current/previous approach rate. Perspecitve modifiers aren&amp;rsquo;t column-specific either.
Hallway Desc: The notefield is tilted away from the player, so that notes start far away and come closer.</description></item><item><title>Column movement</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-3-Column-Movement-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-3-Column-Movement-Mods/</guid><description>Column movement modifiers allow one to move the columns in any direction. Usually, these are used to create &amp;ldquo;column swaps&amp;rdquo;, which alter the visual order of the columns in gameplay.
Flip Desc: Flip alters the column order to make it appear backwards. For Example, if the column order is usually left down up right, the order becomes right up down left.
Negative values have been used to space out the columns, so values from -200% to 100% could be possible.</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 4.5.6 Build</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.5.6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.5.6/</guid><description> Release Date: 8th May 2020 All platforms Aligned inline sine math with NotITG.

This is often used to change from upscroll to downscroll among other effects.
Reverse Desc: Reverse flips the scroll of the whole notefield from upscroll to downscroll. There is also a column-specific version that adds onto the value of normal Reverse.
Commonly, 50% or 100% is used on its&amp;rsquo; own.
Quirks: When going over 100%, the effect goes backwards, with 200% being normal upscroll again.</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 4.4 Build</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.4/</guid><description>Release Date: 4th March 2020 Alpha 4.4.1 changes Properly removed the obsolete input handlers - seems there was a separate one added to a lone screen. Cheers, Glenn. Fixed missing keystrokes on profile creation and high score name entry.

Some noteskins may affect how the effect looks due to how rotation and zoom interact in the notefield.
OutFox and Open/NotITG act the same way, while earlier versions of SM5 may act differently.
Dizzy Desc: Notes spin as they reach the receptor, with more rotationz added the farther away from the receptor a note is.</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 4.3 Build</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.3/</guid><description>Release Date: 9th February 2020 All platforms Fixed various missing keyboard inputs, including symbol keys (;:&amp;rsquo;@#,&amp;lt;&amp;gt;./?|`{}[])(&amp;amp;^%$&amp;quot;), the ~ key for localised keyboards, and the number pad. Fixed missing options for no mapping on localised keyboards. 🐲 Add touchscreen and mouse input hooks 🐲 Added hooks for haptic/rumble support on controllers. Why?

Zoom works a bit differently in SM5 in that it also affects the z axis unlike in ITG/SM3.95, which only affect x &amp;amp; y.
Extra scaling may be required if recreating effects between ITG and SM5.
Mods that work on the note and column-level may make holds look a bit weird due to how hold scaling works.
Mini Desc: Mini scales down the entire notefield, while maintaining the receptor position.</description></item><item><title>Acceleration</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-7-Acceleration-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-7-Acceleration-Mods/</guid><description>Acceleration modifiers mess with the vertical acceleration of the note. It lets people have notes speed up, slow down, or do a 180 among other things.
Boomerang Desc: Notes start flying out from the top of the screen, do a 180 at around the bottom of the screen, and go back towards the receptors.
The modifier has a simple on/off nature, so any nonzero magnitude will work. (Unless the VariableBoomerang sub modifier is in play)</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 4.2 Build</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/releases/A4.2/</guid><description>Release Date: 5th February 2020 Windows build was pulled due to bugs.

Cover Desc: Cover hides the song background. The range between fully lit and fully hidden scales based on the current value of the BGBrightness preference.
Use negative amounts to bring back the background if BGBrightness is less than 1. A lot of modfiles use large amounts of negative cover to deal with any positive value BGBrightness could have.</description></item><item><title>OutFox Alpha 3.0 to 4.0 Roadmap</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/roadmap/2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/roadmap/2019/</guid><description>OutFox Alpha 3.0 to 4.0 Roadmap The following list is what the project planned and needed to have ready in time for our first public Alpha build that was released on the 16th December 2019.

Drunk Desc: Drunk makes the notes and receptors move left and right in a constantly shifting sinusoidal wave. There are extra variants for the Y and Z axis, as well as tangent variants.
Common values can be practically any value, due to its&amp;rsquo; wide use in modfiles.</description></item><item><title>About Project OutFox</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/meta/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/meta/about/</guid><description>What is Project OutFox? Project OutFox is a fork of StepMania 5.1. The project began to improve the main repo and it&amp;rsquo;s codebase, however due to community feedback and response the project changed direction into what it is today; A working museum of scrolling rhythm games playable within a single client.
The team provides a free-to-play cross-platform engine supporting and supported by the many new communities and areas that OutFox now supports.</description></item><item><title>BMS/BME/PMS Support</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mode-support/bms-pms-support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mode-support/bms-pms-support/</guid><description>Project OutFox contains parsers for the BMS and PMS chart formats, which are the standard formats used in conjunction with mostly the be-mu and po-mu game types.

A lot of these follow similar behaviors to the Visibility modifiers, alongside with some extra functionalities.
&amp;lt;color&amp;gt; can be 'ColorType_Red', 'ColorType_Blue' or 'ColorType_Green', and is how one chooses the color channel to affect.
These modifiers generally share usable values between 0 to 100%.
StealthColor Desc: Bring a color channel of the notes down to zero (This does not affect the actual glow color).</description></item><item><title>Controlling Sound</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/actortypes/sound/Sound-ControllingSound/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/actortypes/sound/Sound-ControllingSound/</guid><description>The Def.Sound actor is part of RageSound, another component in the engine that deals with audio, and they both work together to provide playback of said sounds. That said, in order to control specific elements from them, you must understand how to access them.
Only using commands directly inside Def.Sound will provide commands related to the sound actor; to use commands related to its RageSound component, you must get() the component.</description></item><item><title>Doing Mods with Def.NoteField</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/actortypes/notefield/DefNoteField-RunningModifiers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/actortypes/notefield/DefNoteField-RunningModifiers/</guid><description>Usually, a Player controls a NoteField, which includes positioning, zooming, rotation and vanish point manipulation. The game itself would also handle approach rates for modifiers used on a Player.
With Def.NoteField, this is now done manually, since there is no &amp;ldquo;Player&amp;rdquo; to handle everything.
Applying modifiers Applying modifiers is instant, unlike the approach rate behavior usually seen.
This can be done through multiple ways:
1. Using the ModsFromString function in the NoteField.</description></item><item><title>DTX &amp; GDA/G2D Support</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mode-support/dtx-gda-support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mode-support/dtx-gda-support/</guid><description>Preview shot of this mode from Alpha 4.9.8 with fallback theme Project OutFox contains parsers for the DTX and GDA/G2D chart formats, which are the standard formats used in conjunction with the gddm and gdgf game types. The following table contains details on the DTX/GDA/G2D channels that Project OutFox currently supports.
We have recently added parsing support for the guitar/bass side of this chart format, and we will also look at creating a new easier to use format for gdgf in the future which supports 3/5 and 6 fret which has been requested by our community.</description></item><item><title>Ensuring string compatibility</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/actortypes/bitmaptext/Bitmap-EnsuringStringComp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/actortypes/bitmaptext/Bitmap-EnsuringStringComp/</guid><description>When applying text on a BitmapText actor, depending on the font, some glyphs might not present themselves properly. Let&amp;rsquo;s take the following example, which attempts to load a text with the value H̶e̵a̶d̸g̷r̴i̸n̶d̴e̴r̶, which is Headgrinder with some special unicode to add non-spacing strikes in the text.
In this example, the glyphs representing the special unicode symbols are not found in this custom font, so they show ? symbols instead (from the Common default glyph image list), to indicate the missing element.</description></item><item><title>Hidden Regions &amp; NoteType Multipliers</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/actortypes/notefield/NoteField-HiddenRegions+NoteTypeMult/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/actortypes/notefield/NoteField-HiddenRegions+NoteTypeMult/</guid><description>Hidden Regions &amp;amp; NoteType Mult are two sets of functions that allow for manipulating notes.
Hidden Regions Hidden Regions specify parts of the chart to not draw. If a hold head is in the segment, the entire hold will not draw.
Can be cleared with clear_hidden_regions or ClearHiddenRegions and also takes an optional parameter for column.
Input format The input is a table of tables.

This page documents what gets affected and how.
Note that this is useful knowledge if trying to replicate some modifiers on a Def.NoteField by itself or if you need something to follow what a Player does. Any part that relies in reverse/downscroll only takes effect when the first column is more than 50% towards downscroll.
All modifiers mentioned are calculated in floating point format, so 150% would be represented as 1.</description></item><item><title>Inline-Text manipulation</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/actortypes/bitmaptext/Bitmap-InlineColoring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/actortypes/bitmaptext/Bitmap-InlineColoring/</guid><description>Starting from SM5 Preview 1, BitmapText actors can include special instructions to manipulate separate glyphs with things like color.

Every function mentioned has a snake case alias.
DidTapNote / DidHoldNote These two functions allow for forcing a noteflash on the columns.
Both functions take three parameters: Column (First column is 1), a TapNoteScore/HoldNoteScore and whether to use the &amp;ldquo;bright&amp;rdquo; variant. (&amp;ldquo;Bright&amp;rdquo; is what&amp;rsquo;s normally used when the current combo is over a certain threshold.)

It is recommended that you do not install it to the Program Files directory, as this is known to cause problems. The installer offers optional components, such as the noteskins that were included with StepMania 5.0.12 and 5.1, and &amp;ldquo;Toasties&amp;rdquo; - animations that can trigger on combo milestones in-game.

These describe what frame in a spritesheet the actor should focus on and for how long in seconds.
Sprites that use a video file do not apply for this guide, as the sprite only recognizes it as a single frame, given it&amp;rsquo;s now using FFMpeg to handle playback of said video. For this, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to obtain the Sprite&amp;rsquo;s RageTexture and use the position function, which handles its value in seconds.</description></item><item><title>Obtaining Childs and ActorFrame Levels</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/actortypes/actor/obtainlevels/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/actortypes/actor/obtainlevels/</guid><description>When using Actors, you can use self:GetParent() and self:GetChild() to get elements from other ActorFrames or Actors. self:GetChild() can only be used by ActorFrames.

About History: This mode started life as a notes loader for obscure dance charts created in 1998, with 4 key and 6 key being supported. 4k doubles seemed to appear around 2000, before being replaced completely with MSD/DWI around the same time. The loader has been present for a very long time in the games history, not adding actual BMS support until 2003.</description></item><item><title>Game Module: bongo</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/bongo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/bongo/</guid><description>About It parses files made for taitai into a lane mode to play on a bongo based controller, or bongo based midi controller.

It was rendered almost unplayable due to the rapid code changes of the time, and was fixed in the side fork of 3.9.5 around spring 2004.
In the development of SM 4.0, this mode was broken with the rapid changes brought into the game and was then fixed again by Team SSC in StepMania 5 Preview 4 aroun 2010, restoring doubles and noteskin support.</description></item><item><title>Getting started</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/setup/getting-started/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/setup/getting-started/</guid><description>To obtain the best experience, there are a few things you should do after installing Project OutFox. Some of these instructions assume usage of the included default theme (Soundwaves).
Selecting a game type When launching Project OutFox for the first time or without save data present, you will be prompted to select which game type you would like to begin with. Project OutFox supports a variety of game types, which you can learn about here, which simulate different types of rhythm games (including button layouts and, where applicable, gameplay behaviours specific to the game type).</description></item><item><title>ModSplines</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-11-ModSplines/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-11-ModSplines/</guid><description>ModSplines is a system that allows for arbitrary note pathing through modifiers. This system is based off the spline system used in NotITG, which means it is usable alongside the pre-existing SM5 spline system and other modifiers, too.
Points are positioned like they are for Gradient modifiers, meaning in multiples of ARROW_SIZE away from the receptor.
In SM5, this is only accessible through the PlayerOptions functions, while NotITG has functions available in Player and also has modstring versions available (Though, it&amp;rsquo;s recommended to use the lua functions instead.</description></item><item><title>Anatomy of a screen</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/theming/Theming-3-Anatomy-Screen/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/theming/Theming-3-Anatomy-Screen/</guid><description>A screen generarly consists of 4 separate elements, and 3 special transitional elements, which are its layers. These can contain any kind of object, so they can be Lua scripts, images, video, you name it. These follow a draw order rule to display them.
From draw on top to last (Marked red are the transition-specific layers): graph LR In:::Transition --> Out:::Transition --> Cancel:::Transition --> Decorations --> Overlay --> Underlay --> Background; classDef Transition fill:#f55 To create a file for a specific layer, just name the file as [ScreenName] [layer kind], so for example a Lua file that will control the Overlay layer from ScreenTitleMenu.</description></item><item><title>Chart modifiers</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-12-Chart-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-12-Chart-Mods/</guid><description>Chart modifiers affect the chart itself, meaning what has to be stepped changes. These cannot be called during gameplay, but can be called through attacks &amp;amp; course files. All of these are boolean modifiers. At the moment, some of these aren&amp;rsquo;t properly set up for any game other than dance.
&amp;ldquo;Transform&amp;rdquo; Modifiers Transform modifiers add or remove or alter notes from the chart, affecting how the chart has to be played.</description></item><item><title>Configure controllers</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/setup/controllers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/setup/controllers/</guid><description>On Alpha 4.5 and newer, we switched to using an XInput-compliant input system.
Due to these changes, not all controllers (such as game-pads, dance pads, and other rhythm game-specific controllers) are guaranteed to function with OutFox out of the box (even if they were supported on earlier versions), unless a controller mapping profile has been created for that specific controller.

Often called &amp;ldquo;Modfiles&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Modcharts&amp;rdquo;.
These usually use the FGCHANGES or BGCHANGES of a simfile to load the lua files (if any are used).

Serenity User Profiles Serenity Volume Resume What is OutFox Serenity? OutFox Serenity is the official community song pack project made primarily for Project OutFox. Its purpose is to produce packs of &amp;ldquo;libre&amp;rdquo; songs for the game that can be freely redistributed (including as part of its default, bundled songs), and to showcase the functionality of Project Outfox by offering charts for multiple game types beyond just 4-key/dance.</description></item><item><title>Preferences.ini</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/config/preferences/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/config/preferences/</guid><description>Preferences.ini is a file that contains many of the system preferences. Some of them are accessible within Project OutFox&amp;rsquo;s settings menu, but some of them are only accessible by editing the file.

You can think of them as images that represent each letter.
We have a BitmapText actor, with a default font (Common Normal) that has the following text:

These are always available to use, from anywhere in the theme. However, it is advised to use these sparingly to avoid unnecesary carry over of data, overlapping variable names with other existing Lua naming scopes, and others.
It is recommended practice to ensure script data is kept to a minimum to avoid collision with objects like song data, scores, player data, mods, profile information, song rates, and others.</description></item><item><title>Translation</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/translation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/translation/</guid><description>Are you translating a theme to another language? Reading this might help you.
Where are language files stored Inside every theme, there&amp;rsquo;ll be a Languages folder. Inside that folder is where language files are stored. Example:
Languages/ en.ini ja.ini Here we can see 2 language files: en for English and ja for Japanese. It&amp;rsquo;s a standard to name language files in that format (language-COUNTRY.ini). For example: In this case, there&amp;rsquo;s a Portuguese translation, but since there&amp;rsquo;s also Portuguese from Portugal, the file was named pt-BR (BR = Brazil).</description></item><item><title>Tweening</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/ActorsLua-Tweening/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/ActorsLua-Tweening/</guid><description>Actors have the ability to transition from point A to point B using Tweening.
It allows for queueing up movements &amp;amp; transitions on position, size, color and other attributes as well as commands and messages.
Queueing-style tweens These help with queueing actions after a certain amount of time.
Sleep The actor waits for a given amount of seconds before performing the next command.

These can be loaded by using the LoadModule function. Depending on the return methodology from the module, it can be called in several ways.
Given the loading nature of modules, it is not recommended to use LoadModule directly if the function that will load it is called too quickly (like calling the module inside of a JudgmentMessageCommand), specially with modules that require file loading/saving.</description></item><item><title>Serenity User Profile</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/meta/serenity_user_profile/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/meta/serenity_user_profile/</guid><description>Select User:
