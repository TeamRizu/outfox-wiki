The OutFox chart editor brings a lot of new elements that can assist you on chart and modfile creations.
{{< hint warning >}}
The editor is constantly being updated, so a lot of changes might happen between versions.
These changes will be tagged with the version number next to it (ex. [(4.11.0)](/releases/4.11.0.md)) to determine the 
version that introduced this change.
