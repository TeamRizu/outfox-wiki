There are a few things you should do after installing Project OutFox.

Some of these instructions assume usage of the included default theme
(Soundwaves).

<br />

## Selecting a game type

{{< columns size="large" >}} <!-- begin columns block -->

When launching Project OutFox for the first time (or without save data present),
you will be prompted to select which **game type** you would like to begin with.

Project OutFox supports a variety of [game types](/user-guide/games/), which
simulate the button layouts and game mechanics of different types of rhythm
games. Game types are further divided into **styles**, which are permutations
such as alternate controller usage.

The most popular game type, `dance`, is placed at the top. If this is your first
time playing OutFox, this is a straightforward and easy-to-understand game mode
with plenty of content readily available for download.

{{< hint type="important" >}} Songs that do not support the currently selected
game mode will not display in the song list. Please ensure you are using the
correct game mode for the content you are trying to play.

**Tip:** You can switch between game types at any time using the "Select Game"
button on the main menu.{{</hint>}}

## Install songs

{{< columns size="large" >}} <!-- begin columns block -->

While Project OutFox does include a few sample songs, you will probably want to
add more. We support a number of formats, including SM, SSC, SMA, DWI, BMS, DTX,
.CHART, and KSF.

There are countless community resources for song packs. A great appetizer is our
own project, [OutFox Serenity](https://projectoutfox.com/outfox-serenity).

Place downloaded songs into the [Songs folder](/user-guide/config/folders/)
inside the game's **installation directory**, or alternatively in the **User
folder**.

- `~/Library/Preferences/Project OutFox/` on macOS
- `~/.project-outfox/` on Linux
- `%APPDATA%\Project OutFox` on Windows

This folder is divided into **Groups** (also sometimes known as "packs").
Groups, in turn, contain folders for each song.

Here is an example of how the folder structure would look for the song
highlighted in the example screenshot.

```
Songs
│
└───Club Fantastic Season 1 (GROUP)
│   │   
│   └───COOL_EXCEPTION (SONG)
│       │   
│       │   COOL_EXCEPTION.ssc
│       │   COOL_EXCEPTION.ogg
│       │   COOL_EXCEPTION-bg.png
│       │   COOL_EXCEPTION-bn.png
│       │   COOL_EXCEPTION-jk.png
```

Packs are typically distributed as ZIP files. Extract the archive with your
preferred software, and copy the group folder containing the song directories to
the Songs folder, matching the structure above.

{{< hint info>}} **Note:** If the songs do not appear, be sure to check that you
have not accidentally nested your folders too deep inside a redundant folder.
{{</hint>}}

{{< hint info>}} **Note:** If a song is not contained inside a group folder, but
instead on the root Songs directory, the game will stop loading to let you know
of the Song folder in question. {{< /hint >}}

## Configuring your controls

{{< columns size="large" >}} <!-- begin columns block -->

Project OutFox supports a wide variety of controllers and even arcade hardware.
To configure your button mappings, go to **Options > Input & Calibration >
Config Key/Joy Mappings**.

Use the arrow keys to select an item to map, press Enter, and then press the
button on the keyboard or controller you want to use. You can have multiple
button assignments for each command.

Each game type has its own default keyboard configuration. For example, `dance`
maps the first player to the arrow keys. (when playing on keyboard, this is
often referred to as the "index" playstyle).

<br />

### Controller not working?

If your controller does not perform as well or function as expected, you can
switch to the alternate XInput input mode from **Options > Experimental
Settings**.

![The "Use Legacy Input System" setting, with HIDAPI highlighted.](/getting-started/enable-hidapi.jpg)

XInput will sometimes also require you to map your controller to the input
engine's virtual gamepad, allowing the game to properly interface with the
device.

This menu can be found at **Options > Input & Calibration > Map Controller**.

## Calibrate your audio sync

{{< columns size="large" >}} <!-- begin columns block -->

In a rhythm game, timing is everything. But latency produced by your audio
outputs can affect your accuracy. If you feel like the game is not judging your
timing accurately, you can interactively adjust the audio offset.

**Options > Input & Calibration > Calibrate Audio Sync**

{{< hint type="caution" >}} Interactive calibration only works under the `dance`
game type. If you are using a differtent game type, temporarily switch to
`dance`, and switch back when you are done. {{< /hint >}}

{{< hint type="important" >}} Tap the notes based on what you HEAR, not what you
SEE. {{< /hint >}}

A song will play with a pattern of alternating notes; in the `dance` game type,
they will be left and right arrows.

This calibration will repeat continuously. Every 24 notes, your inputs will be
used to calculate a new offset. Once you feel the judgment has been set
correctly, press the `Back` button (mapped to Escape by default). It will ask
you for confirmation in setting the new offset.

<---> <!-- magic separator, between columns -->

![Audio calibration screen.](/getting-started/sync-screen.jpg)

{{< /columns >}}

Alternatively, if you wish to automatically calibrate in-game while playing your
song of choice, you can press `F6` twice during gameplay to enable **AutoSync
Machine**, which will last until the end of the song or when exited with the
`Back` button. A message will appear asking to confirm your changes.

<br /><br />

## Audio Latency

If something still feels off, you might be playing a gamemode with
**keysounds**, which means the user's button inputs will trigger a sound when
pressed.

Audio latency is a massive problem for these game modes, because there will be a
delay between the user's button press and the sound that is played. Merely
calibrating the judgment window will not improve latency.

On Windows, it is strongly recommended to use an **ASIO** driver to ensure
lowest possible latency. Mac and Linux users should already obtain low latency
output without any special configuration.

## Create a profile

{{< columns size="large" >}} <!-- begin columns block -->

By default, OutFox saves data to a global "machine profile". However, there is
certain data that will not persist between sessions, such as high scores and
player settings.

You can manage profiles from **Options > Profiles**. From here you can create a
profile, and edit existing profiles.

From the profile editor (highlight a profile and press Start, and then select
"Edit profile"), you can input fitness-related information, change the layout of
the optional "Detailed Stats" pane during gameplay, and add an avatar to your
profile (avatars are loaded from the Appearance/Avatars directory).
