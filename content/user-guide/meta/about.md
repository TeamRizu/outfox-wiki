## What is Project OutFox?

Project OutFox is a fork of StepMania 5.1. The project began to improve the main repo and it's codebase, however due to community feedback and response the project changed direction into what it is today; A working museum of scrolling rhythm games playable within a single client.

The team provides a free-to-play cross-platform engine supporting and supported by the many new communities and areas that _OutFox_ now supports. It continues the legacy of the early pre 3.0 _StepMania_ developers: to enable everyone to enjoy the rhythm no matter what game they play, or what they play it on.

The original aims (kept here for history) were as follows, most of these have now been met:

* Refactoring its internal codebase to improve performance, adhere to modern coding practices, and enhance its capabilities on modern hardware and other platforms. 
* Working on support for single-board ARM systems such as Raspberry Pi, including the new M1 ARM systems, and improve performance on legacy systems.
* Continue the legacy of StepMania 3; Refactor the ideas and visions from the early developers in making the game a fully fledged engine, not just focused primarily on one mode.
* Restoring and improving support for other modes beyond dance.
* Provide the facility to allow better customisation and 'modding' of the UI and functions. We are planning to make the project a cross-platform "sandbox" for rhythm games, rather than simply a simulator for popular dance game franchises.
* Create a working museum of rhythm games for the newer generation to experience the major Boom of the early 2000s in a convenient way.

As Project OutFox is a continuation of the 5.0.12 and 5.1 codebase (not “5.2”), it remains compatible with almost all existing songs, themes, and noteskins that are supported on these versions (if you do encounter odd behaviour or other issues with older content, please report it to us as a bug). Project OutFox is unrelated to 5.1 -3 (sometimes written as 5.1-3), which was a prior build of 5.2 before it was renamed.
