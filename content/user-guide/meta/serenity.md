## What is OutFox Serenity?

OutFox Serenity is the official community song pack project **made primarily for Project OutFox**. Its purpose is to produce packs of "libre" songs for the game that can be freely redistributed (including as part of its default, bundled songs), and to showcase the functionality of Project Outfox by offering charts for multiple game types beyond just 4-key/dance.


## How was OutFox Serenity created?

During Project OutFox Alpha 4.8.0 development, we started to release many modes, however, some of those modes have complicated chart standards or no longer have support. We decided then that it was right to create a community pack based on StepMania StepMix where the community would contribute for songs to be bundled with the game, but this time, songs for every mode OutFox supports.

## How can I contribute to OutFox Serenity?

1. Make sure to [read our guidelines](https://projectoutfox.com/serenity-guidelines) to understand the rules of contribution and submission.
2. Fill [our online form](https://projectoutfox.com/community-pack-submissions) selecting the option of which you want to submit and any other required information. 


- If you have **music** that follows our **Music guidelines**, then please submit it using [our online form](https://projectoutfox.com/community-pack-submissions), once you submit you have agreed that we have permission to store/share your content with members of our team to organize the selection of future volumes of OutFox Serenity and that the public has permission to Stream/Record and Upload Videos playing Project OutFox with your songs, our channel will upload your song to Project OutFox Youtube Channel and that your song can be featured in arcades, as long as your song is selected.

- We will request you to use our templates which can be found on the [Project OutFox Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mNcFU67mK7). Make sure to check the pinned messages as they include each game mode scaling.

## Does OutFox Serenity work with other StepMania forks?

No, the packages we provide include content which will not work with other StepMania forks and can even cause crashes when trying to load them.

Contributors and the Serenity Team prepare the pack with Project OutFox performance and behavior in mind, even if some individual chart works with those older forks.

## How do I update my packs?

When a new version comes out, we release multiple packages, usually it will be like this:

 - All in One, this package will include all content from all volumes
 - X Volume Only, this package will include only the new volume and its content. (It **WON'T** include new content for older volumes that were produced during the development of the new volume)

 We recommend you to download the "All in One", delete the content inside your local OutFox Serenity groups and replace with what is inside the new All in One package, this way you avoid losing scores (Unless the chart has been updated), the general idea is to keep everything with the same directory path. It is not recommened to just add an replace content this can introduce problems in the future.

## How will Volume 3 work?

Volume 3 will work very different from past volumes, but to make it simple:

- We will reveal 3 songs with SSC Templates and that will be a season.
- Contributors can contribute with charts and graphics.
- After 3 month from the season reveal, we will release that season package and start development of the next season.

Important: 

- TTC (Time to Chart) for every season will be 3 months.
- There's no Testing Weeks, make sure your content is final and meets all our requirements before sending.
- Each season will always have 3 songs at max.
- If a song has charts but no graphics yet, it will use the pack graphics, if after 2 months of the song reveal there's still no graphic for that song, then it will be made by members of the Serenity Team.

## Can I Stream/Record and Upload Videos of me playing Serenity Songs or use them in a Arcade?

Yes! In case you want to be extra secure, each song folder in our package includes a text file with licenses for the Song and Graphics. (If a section isn't include for one of those, you can assume you're safe.)

## Are modfiles allowed to be submitted?

Yes. But make sure its gimmicks only work with your specific chart/difficulty, no chart should impact other's charts in any way.

## I submitted music but it wasn't featured on the next volume/season, why?

Our team has a list of music submitted by members of the community, we try to select a safe amount of music that guarantees a healthy amount of charts will be made for each one since chart and graphic submissions are made purely by the interest of the authors and at the moment of writing this document, Project OutFox has no dedicated Chart Creation Team.

Another possible reason is that your submission does not follow the **music guidelines**, if you think that is the case then you can contact us using the following socials:

- [Discord](https://discord.gg/mNcFU67mK7)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutFox) (Post or Private Message any Mods)
- [Project OutFox Forum](https://discourse.projectmoon.dance/) (Create a post)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/projectoutfox) (Private Message)
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ProjectOutFox/) (Private Message)
- [Github](https://github.com/TeamRizu/OutFox/discussions) (New Discussion)

Make sure to check any of the socials you provided to us, if we are considering using your music but it's missing something, we will try to contact you.

## Why are some music files missing from the repository?

Those are special as they use a license that doesn't allow us to publicly host them on Github, they are still bundled with our release zips.
