## About:

## History:

This mode was re-added towards the end of the alpha 4 development cycle of _Project OutFox_ at the end of 2021. It is a simulation of the game _StepManiaX_ by StepRevolution, and was created with their blessing. It began life on our original base development back in 2018, when the project was codenamed _FoxMania_.

## Trivia

This game module will not support the special timing methodology that is used in the arcade version due to a limitation in the software, and will not support any official 'data' from the sim-files used in the original game.

Due to a massive corruption issue on the gitlab server that hosted our work, we lost several months of development time, and had to restart the project when we were still using the _FoxMania_ codename. The version written back then does not reflect the current implementation, so it has to be considered replaced.
