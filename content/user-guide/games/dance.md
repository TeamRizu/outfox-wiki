## Supported Parser Types:

This mode is _parser agnostic_. It will load 4k charts from a variety of formats.

The table below lists the supported files and their types that ``dance`` supports, their panel/key value and the original mode the parser is used for (if any).

File Type|Label|Original Mode|Key Values Supported|Notes 
------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
 ``.bms`` | BMS | ``dance`` | 4k / 6k / 8k | 4k dance / 6k dance / 4k dance doubles in be-mu charts
 ``.dwi`` | DWI | ``dance`` | 4k / 6K | legacy _dance with intensity_ charts
 ``.sm/.ssc`` | SM | ``dance`` | 3k / 4k / 6k / 8k  | 3k dance / 4k dance / 6k dance / 4k dance doubles

_Project OutFox_ added ``double`` and ``versus`` modes to solo and threepanel at the beginning of 2022 due to community request and demand. These charts will not parse on legacy builds of _StepMania_.
