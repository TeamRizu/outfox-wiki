## About

## History:

This mode was originally created to simulate a popular game using a guitar shaped controller. It was added in StepMania 4, however work to finish it was not completed. It was rewritten and added back in Project OutFox in Spring 2021.

### Introduced (StepMania 4):
#### 5 Key:

First Seen:
 * StepMania v4.0 CVS - ``(guitar-five)`` (23 September 2006) (Non-Functional)

**Removed**
 * StepMania v5.0 preview 2 - ``(guitar-five)`` (30 July 2011) (sm-ssc v2.1)

The mode was removed completely, along with the note types and midi loader support. The fact the mode was only partially working with no wail support, and that there had been no further work completed to solve those issues sounded the end of this mode in mainline SM.
