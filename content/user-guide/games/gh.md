## About

## History:

This mode was originally created to simulate a popular game using a guitar shaped controller. It was added in StepMania 4, however work to finish it was not completed. It was rewritten and added back in Project OutFox in Spring 2021.

### Introduced (StepMania 4):
#### 5 Key:

First Seen:
 * StepMania v4.0 CVS - ``(guitar-five)`` (23 September 2006) (Non-Functional)

**Removed**
 * StepMania v5.0 preview 2 - ``(guitar-five)`` (30 July 2011) (sm-ssc v2.1)

The mode was removed completely, along with the note types and midi loader support. The fact the mode was only partially working with no wail support, and that there had been no further work completed to solve those issues sounded the end of this mode in mainline SM.

 * Project OutFox alpha 4.9.7.2 - ``(solo)`` (12 March 2021)

## Supported Parser Types:
This mode is _parser specific_. It will only load and parse items designed for the `gh` series of simulations.

The table below lists the supported files and their types that ``gh`` supports, their key/button value and the original mode the parser is used for (if any).

File Type|Label|Original Mode|Key Values Supported|Notes 
------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
 ``.chart`` | CHART | ``gh`` | easy/normal/pro | parser based on the 'gh' era up until around 2014.
 ``.midi`` | MIDI | ``gh`` | easy/normal/normal5/pro |
