## Introducing 0.4.17-LTS!

#### LONG TERM STABLE BUILDS ARE HERE!

As part of our commitment to getting the game out of eventual development spaghetti we have had a discussion and all agreed to keep the alpha 4.xx branch active for the next year while we work on the alpha V branch. 

What this means to you, the end user, is that if you want to not have to change builds all the time and deal with 'new feature' bugs, then this branch will be maintained (for bug fixes only) in a monthly schedule until december, then will move to a quarterly release schedule until it is retired, likely next summer, but that date is very likely to change.

This branch is stable enough to be considered for the removal of the 'alpha' prefix, and if you get anything awry do report it.

## New PandaLog File System

This month we also added a new logging system which will greatly help with any debugging needs that you have. We have changed the system, so that there is a main, a theme, and a crash-log now, and these have varying levels of detail, depending on need. If you happen to have a crash or need to debug a theme, or lua mod, this is now much easier to do.

On the log level preference, 0 shows full detail, where 5 will give you a reduced log-file, usually when you have everything set up and working well.

## LTS Updates:

This month again has been mostly bug fixes. Some small updates and back-ports from Alpha V will always happen, as we cannot have things too unstable of course.
