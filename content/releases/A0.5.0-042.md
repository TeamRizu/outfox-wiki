## OutFox 0.5.0 Pre-Release Candidate 042-a36 SSE3 (Main PRETEST PlayTest Build) December 19th 2023

The OpenGL renderer is now considered deprecated as of this pre-alpha, and OutFox will try to use GLAD first. If that fails, it will fall back to the legacy renderer. This is due to performance and modernisation code we've added the last 2 builds, which gives the game a better usage and speed on systems. You need a GPU from newer than 2005 to support GLAD, or RPi 2+

* ❕✅ Fixed imagecache predefined settings at start
* ❕✅ Set imagecache to resize above 512px by default
* ❕✅ ensure we cache jackets, banners and backgrounds by default
* ❕✅ Fixed invalid bones in characters
* ❕✅ Fixed DancingCharacter loading
* ❕✅ Fixed character bone loading
* ❕✅ Reverted StepsType Change to give notice of the upcoming changes. This will now happen in 044
* ❕✅ Fixed legacy drivers for now on sound
* ❕✅ Fixed sound latency on RPi and SteamDeck/ROG Ally
* ❕✅ Fixed crash with missing stepstypes


Theme Updates:

- Fixed null or 0 profile fitness goals from invoking the resume screen
- Added support for SongSampleModes
(Just like in Soundwaves, you can select the mode in the Experimental settings)
- Added option to toggle Jackets from the music wheel
- Fixed last played text displaying wrong information
- Fix difficulty change not updating high score grade
- Fix style graphics being broken in Evaluation and Edit mode

### Theme Updates: 

Dance Alpha V:

- Redone the Fitness menu to have a better display for one player
interaction, specifically with touch users.
- You can now select a goal to start a fitness session.
- Graphs in DetailedStats are now properly reset when in Course mode.
- Reworked FadeSlide module for more understandable implementation.
This now allows for precise application of actors and smoother motion
as it is no longer tied to tweens. This new version is stored in
Text.NewFadeSlide.lua, and the original one will be deprecated.

- Join button during attract now goes to Select Profile.
- TotalTimer now updates when changing a song.
- Added options to go to the wiki and the OutFox discord server.
- OptionList now supports URLs.
- Removed approximate difficulties from DiffSelector.
While they're neat looking to see what difficulties are ahead, I can't
deny that they can be disorienting; specially when both areas were
implemented, so I scrapped it and made the parts where you cannot
scroll more obvious.

- SongInfoBox's Title now updates like a scroller.
Given the new updated I did for FadeSlide, this now has better control
when scrolling through songs with long titles, even groups.

- Discord module now just says Attract Screen if its in demonstration.
- Discord module can now track when the player has paused the game,
and show how long have they paused the game, and reapply the remaining
time when resuming.

* ❕✅ Fixed build env for legacy systems as we're using newer libraries
* ❕✅ Fixed dual input on def.optionslist
* ❕✅ Fixed missing playernumber on def.optionslist
* ❕✅ NEW!! Working SteamDeck standalone driver! This driver allows the game to properly work with the deck's controls, which allows for extra joystick/pads/controllers to be plugged in, without Steam overwriting the input causing some of those buttons to be lost when pressed. it requires a different driver setup.

You need to use:
InputDrivers=sdeck,SDL

or if you're using midi as well,
InputDrivers=portmidi,sdeck,SDL

or just the deck:
InputDrivers=sdeck,minisdl

This driver works on windows and linux - it's not complete, I need to disable the mouse/keyboard emulation, but once that is done, we're golden.

* ❕✅ Fixed frame limiter system - if you have an unstable vsync, you can now force a frame rate using the UpdateDrawLoopSeconds pref, which will give you a set FPS update! 

NOTE: If you have an ASUS/Alienware/ACER Gaming/DELL Gaming/MSI Gaming/Medion Gaming/Sapphire Gaming/Sammsung Gaming/HP Gaming system and are running Windows 11 - it will try to throttle your machine to reduce your 'carbon footprint' check your control centre, and your GPU/Controlpanel settings.

## OutFox 0.5.0 Pre-Release Candidate 042-a14 SSE3 (Main PRETEST PlayTest Build) - August 8th 2023

* ❕✅ NEW!! Introducing support for OutFox's 19th Game Mode - Boxing! This mode is designed to be set up at a gym and played with joy-cons or a similar setup. It's great fun and has a variety of punch styles. We are working on gyro/VRK support so you can play this with those controllers.

* ❕✅ NEW!! Introducing support for OutFox's 20th Game Mode - rb! This mode compliments our gh mode and is based on the familiar chart format .mid The game supports. the mode is made up of rb-easy, which is the normal 4 drum lane without the kick, rb-normal, which is the usual 4 drum lane and supporting the kick, and rb-pro, which is 4 drums, 1 kick and 3 cymbals. You can utilise songs from gh which contain drum charts easily enough! 

.chart is going to be worked on later on, this is just the skeleton remember, so a theme and mode specification and changes will happen to improve the game module, as is done with all our supported games.

This mode also makes OutFox the only sim in the world to support 4 Different game drum modules: gddm, taiko, bongo, rb. We hope you'll be as hype as us for this milestone, and to continue improving our coverage and accuracy in the modules that we support.

rb supports PRO DRUMS out of the box, again the theme is lacking as we need to stop developing crap and focus on it in Q3/4 of this year. This mode also supports our MIDI drivers for eDrum kits! you can now use your eDrums on more than one drum mode!

* ❕✅ NEW!! drum, pro-drum lane support for the mid parser! This required a major rewrite of the parsing system to match one similar to gddm/gdgf so the game knew which part of the chart was drum and such. Please test and let us know if there are any MIDI songs that have issues. Remember .chart hasn't been adjusted yet!

## Note: Mods will be called Gimmicks in Project OutFox moving forward, as we have more modes that use this term, and 'mods' are used for speed, rather than snazzy arrow/object effects. Thanks for understanding! 


To play Gimmick Charts on this build of OutFox, you need to select the GROOVE mode. We have removed the main Gimmick lists and crazy sides from the Dance Mode for performance concerns for folks that play Acc/Stamina. 

Thanks for your support as always, and we hope you like these changes, I know it's a bit mad with all the new gimmicks, but these have been requested for some time.

### THIS BUILD HAS A NEW SOUND BACK END!!


This build utilises a new back end and completely does away with the old SM5 drivers. It was super heavily requested by the community that we have something configurable that could be used to lower latency in the game for key-sounded and hit sounded modes, so we delayed this build to squeeze it in. There are still a couple of bugs which will be ironed out, but for 99% of users, this build will work fine.

LOW LATENCY AUDIO GET!

With lower latency, comes some compromises. It is super clear and sharp, you have better clarity, it obviously uses new drivers, which include some new preferences, see below.


We have discovered Discord does NOT like low latency based drivers... AT ALL. please bear this in mind if you decide to play with ASIO/set your CoreAudio below 1024, and ensure you have a secondary sound card Discord can use, so you aren't greeted with silence.

WINDOWS:
ASIO supports down to a blocksize of 32 in the internal driver, now while you can set this in the new preferences (see below) if you hear crackling or garbled audio, just raise this a bit. You can use anything from 32 to 4096 as your block size, higher values being higher latency.

WASAPI supports from 64 to 4096, and replaces waveout as the default driver. It has the benefit of not being legacy or using an old back end to output, and can have it's buffer lowered to suit the system.

Lastly we have DirectSound, mainly due to the fact it has been requested for older windows builds, but users should always try to see if WASAPI (which is Vista ->) is available. DirectSound is 512 ->

The new driver has had to be sample rate locked and hardcoded to 44.1kHz right now due to limitations in the back end, but we will be removing all the old legacy code in the coming months, so you will be able to enjoy 48kHz clarity really soon.

LINUX:
ALSA now uses a new back end, as well as no longer using a 15 year out of date code pathway, we no longer have to patch it for OutFox. It fully supports shared mode, so no more silence on calls when you're using it, and it also behaves better on the Raspberry Pi/SoC board for arm, fixing the 10+ year old bugs. If your kernel is pre 4.12, you may get a crash on the first run due to the old kernel code, but the game should find your system devices properly on the second run. We're looking into this atm.

PulseAudio now runs without the ALSA hook, and again isn't exclusive or forces weirdness. It can run with low latency as well, as well as sharing properly. At this release, it will likely use the ALSA device, but we will be adding the option to choose the device the specific APIs can use, so watch this space for that. There is also a quirk with Pulse where it reports the output and input devices back to front, so we have put in a workaround for this too.

JACK - Jack now is built in without the need for extra hooks or compiler options, and simply just... works. If you do not use this driver, do not add it to your preferences, as this can cause a crash right now, it will be fixed in the final version of 041. JACK is also available on MacOS, a bonus feature there.

BSD/CONSOLE:
OSS 4+ is available for BSD builds

MACOS:
CoreAudio now runs newer code as well, which also fixes the odd quirk in Ventura with the audio thread sometimes dropping out. We will also add code for audio device handover, as this new driver supports it, so no more crashing when your bluetooth headphones die and disconnect. Be warned, however, Bluetooth audio can not take a too low block setting, so experiment.


### New Preferences in this build

SextetStreamInputFilename=
Used for the new Sextet input handler I forgot to code in >.>

SoundrtAudioAPIName=
This selects the audio back end for your system. It will be self populated on first run with a safe default, but you can override it with a comma'ed list of inputs.

You have a choice of the following:

MacOS
core - Use for CoreAudio
jack - Use for JACK

Linux
alsa - Use for ALSA
jack - Use for Jack
pulse - Use for PulseAudio
oss - Use for the Linux OpenSoundSystem

Windows
asio - Use for ASIO
wasapi - Use for WASAPI
ds - Use for DirectSound

They can be used as a list with commas, so "wasapi,ds,asio"

SoundrtAudioLastUsedCard=
This is a pref to highlight the last used card, it's purely for the internal driver, like 'lastseenvideocard'

SoundrtAudioNumberofChannels=
This pref is for number of output channels/speakers your system supports. It will be up to 8 when the code is written, but for now, leave it at 2, due to the legacy code. It will be ignored if you add anything else!

SoundrtAudioPreferredSampleRate=
This pref is for the samplerate of your device, and will be settable in time. It will return the preferred rate your card wants, but will sadly be set to 44.1 due to the restrictions of the legacy code. Will be unlocked when we remove the rest of RageSound

SoundrtAudioSetBufferSize=
This pref is where you set your latency block size. It supports 32 frame to 4096 frames as per the ASIO/latency standards. If your audio crackles or glitches, remember to adjust this, it is not a bug in the game! With lower latency comes a bit more instability, so bear this in mind when you adjust this value.

Linux users will need a lowlatency compiled kernel and preferrably a kernel newer than 4.12 to take advantage of this. MacOS users need Big Sur to use < 256, and Windows 7+ for < 128

This driver is not enabled on windows yet due to some quirks with windows 10/11 which we are looking into.

PLEASE NOTE: This can cause the audio to clip/distort at high volumes, and we are not responsible for your use of this. It has been a very highly requested community feature and we are happy to be able to bring it to you in this build.

Use R to change the Sound Type, and T and Y to set the volume Down and Up respectively.

## OutFox 5.0.0 Pre-Release Candidate 024 - October 17th 2022

THEME: (From Jose)

* ❕✅ Rewritten Judgement loading procedure.
This basically now lets the game record each judgment graphic per
timing window instead of a singular option to rule them all. This
would've become messy if we've kept it like that.
NOTE: This will run locally on the theme for now, to test if the
new functionality is stable to transfer to fallback.

* ❕✅ Music wheel is now dimmable when entering options
* ❕✅ Touch controls are now a toggle
Now looking back, I can see that this whole thing can become a mess
if we let everything be shown at once, so now the Touch controls are
part of a toggle located on the Options menu, which is off by default.
* ❕✅ Speed is now the main option on Player Options
* ❕✅ Fixed PrevScreen on KnownBugs (Reported by Moneko)
* ❕✅ Apply PlayMode upon entering the music wheel

Def.AudioVisualizer Info:

It can be added to any existing actorframe, in themes, modfiles and noteskins!

To use it just use the following commands (UpdateRate is in seconds: 0.01s to 10s)

```
return Def.ActorFrame{
  Def.AudioVisualzer{
    Amount=128, -- The amount of colums, its from min of 16 to a max of 128.
    LinearPeaks=true, -- define if we want lenear peaks, as in a slow animation when it goes back to 0.
    PeakHeight=40, -- the hight of the columns,
    UpdateRate=0.01, -- the update rate of the columns, the lower the faster, between 10 and 0.01.
    OnCommand=function(self)
      self:SetSound(--[[ A RageSound to set--]])
     -- if SetSound is not set, it will fallback to the cur playing music, this does not work for screen gameplay, in screengameplay do
      self:SetSound(SCREENMAN:GetTopScreen():GetSound())
    end    
  }
}
