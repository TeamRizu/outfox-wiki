The familiar 7K setup we know and love was added later in 2005.
The mode did not see much use and fell into having a broken notesloader around the summer of 2010, making it not work with older BMS files, or files with BME or BML extensions.</description></item><item><title>Game Mode: Dance</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/dance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/dance/</guid><description>About History: This mode was added from the very beginning of the history of the StepMania project, having several different tweaks and fixes done throughout the years.

It was added to provide users with a 5/9/10 lane drum mode that works on linux and Mac OS.
When added, players could use the autogen system to test it out, and there is noticable lag on windows due to the sound drivers. This will be resolved in a future release.
This mode is selectable in the game select screen.</description></item><item><title>Game Mode: gdgf</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/gdgf/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/gdgf/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Game Mode: gh</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/gh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/gh/</guid><description>About History: This mode was originally created to simulate a popular game using a guitar shaped controller.

It was designed to be a keyboard based mode using 7 keys and was requested by the community.
The mode initially started life with 6 columns, but this was resolved when the SSC builds began.
kb7-small was a modded version of the mode, with a much smaller &amp;lsquo;spacebar&amp;rsquo; or middle button. It was more used than it&amp;rsquo;s original, and replaced the original kb7-single as the mode in Project OutFox.</description></item><item><title>Game Mode: kickbox</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/kickbox/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/kickbox/</guid><description>About History: This mode was added in StepMania 5.
