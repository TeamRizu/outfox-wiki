be-mu seven key mine game-play, default legacy theme
About History: This mode started life as a notes loader for obscure dance charts created in 1998, with 4 key and 6 key being supported. 4k doubles seemed to appear around 2000, before being replaced completely with MSD/DWI around the same time. The loader has been present for a very long time in the games history, not adding actual BMS support until 2003.</description></item><item><title>Game Module: bongo</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/bongo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/bongo/</guid><description>About It parses files made for taitai into a lane mode to play on a bongo based controller, or bongo based midi controller. One must hit the left or right bongo drum when it reaches the receptor, or clap your hands when the star appears. Scoring and timing windows are yet to be decided.
History: The parser support for the mode is currently actively developed, and the chart support will be aligned with the taiko simulator based parser support.</description></item><item><title>Game Module: dance</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/dance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/dance/</guid><description>About History: This mode was added from the very beginning of the history of the StepMania project, having several different tweaks and fixes done throughout the years.

The machine was designed with 2 dance pads in front of the cabinet which contained 4 depressible areas in the corners, alongside infra-red sensors which the player would need to wave hands over to count as a &amp;lsquo;hit&amp;rsquo; in the up down left right areas of the pad.</description></item><item><title>Game Module: ez2d</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/ez2d/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/ez2d/</guid><description>About History: This mode was added from the very beginning of the history of the StepMania project, having several different tweaks and fixes done throughout the years.

About History: This mode was added in Project OutFox. It was added to provide users with a 5/9/10 lane drum mode that works on Linux and Mac OS.
When added, players could use the auto-gen system to test it out, and there was noticeable lag on Windows due to the sound drivers. This was resolved in Alpha 4.12, when we rewrote the MIDI input system.</description></item><item><title>Game Module: gdgf</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/gdgf/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/gdgf/</guid><description>About History: This mode was added in Project OutFox. It started as the &amp;ldquo;guitar&amp;rdquo; mode, before the &amp;ldquo;gh&amp;rdquo; mode existed. Around the time the &amp;ldquo;gh&amp;rdquo; mode came into being, this mode was renamed to &amp;ldquo;gdgf&amp;rdquo;, which is the current name.
This mode is selectable in the game select screen.

About History: There was a lot of code produced by Chris Danford for this mode back in 2008, that went seemingly completely unused until it&amp;rsquo;s removal 2 years later. OutFox will use more modern techniques that what was written at the time, and we will restore the vision of the engine having a karaoke mode once again.</description></item><item><title>Game Module: kbm</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/kbm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/kbm/</guid><description>This mode will be added around alpha 4.19.0/alpha 5.0.0-pre45-ish of Project OutFox.

About History: This mode was added in version 3.0.2. There was no support for the associated loaders at this time, nor any theme or scoring updates. Po-mu was rendered accidentally broken during the CVS era of development on StepMania 4 (January 2007), where it was not restored until Project OutFox Alpha 4.9.8 (25th April 2021) with a new notesloader and rewritten internal code.</description></item><item><title>Game Module: pump</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/pump/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/pump/</guid><description>About History: This mode was added from very early on in the 3.0 development cycle. Since then, it has benefitted from having several different tweaks and fixes done throughout the years. In the SSC era of development, pump was actually set as the default (main) game mode for a while, but it has since moved to the second on the game select option. There have been several forks and adaptations of this mode since the sm-ssc 1.</description></item><item><title>Game Module: rb</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/rb/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/rb/</guid><description>About History: This mode supports the drum layouts added to the console guitar games of the late 2000s. Following support that was added for the guitar modes back in 2004 it was possible that support for drums was a potential option in the future, although looking within the codebase we have been unable to find any evidence the mode was planned.
This mode was heavily requested after full midi notes loader support was added for the gh mode, and as of writing only midi charts with drums will load in Outfox.</description></item><item><title>Game Module: smx</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/smx/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/smx/</guid><description>smx songs in music wheel, default theme smx game-play, default legacy theme About: History: This mode was re-added towards the end of the alpha 4 development cycle of Project OutFox at the end of 2021.

In its&amp;rsquo; original form, it was a five-column mode with each note type having its&amp;rsquo; own column. Later, within the same alpha (July 11 2021), it was redone to have the notes be different note types instead of notes in columns, with only one column being needed.
In this mode the parser support for the mode is being actively developed, and the chart support will be aligned with other taiko based simulators to provide parity and coherence for the community.</description></item><item><title>Game Module: techno</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/techno/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/games/techno/</guid><description>About History: This mode was added in the 3.0.2, with the first mode being 8 panel. Like most modes from this period, there were not many theme items or specifics in scoring or timing windows at all. It was rendered almost unplayable due to the rapid code changes of the time, and was fixed in the side fork of 3.9.5 around spring 2004.
In the development of SM 4.0, this mode was broken with the rapid changes brought into the game and was then fixed again by Team SSC in StepMania 5 Preview 4 aroun 2010, restoring doubles and noteskin support.</description></item></channel></rss>
