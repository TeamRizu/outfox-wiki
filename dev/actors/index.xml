OutFox contains a similar feature set as the previous revisions of the game, but with some notable differences. This document aims to provide help with porting content to and from the different versions of the game.
&amp;ldquo;Command&amp;rdquo; format vs &amp;ldquo;Function&amp;rdquo; format Converting commands to the newer function format is generally recommended when porting content to SM5.</description></item><item><title>Command List</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/ActorsLua-CommandList/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/ActorsLua-CommandList/</guid><description>OutFox has actors and actors can have commands.

It allows for queueing up movements &amp;amp; transitions on position, size, color and other attributes as well as commands and messages.
Queueing-style tweens These help with queueing actions after a certain amount of time.
Sleep The actor waits for a given amount of seconds before performing the next command.
hibernate Like sleep, but the actor is also hidden for the duration of the hibernate.</description></item><item><title>Converting INI files to Lua</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/Converting-ini-to-Lua/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/Converting-ini-to-Lua/</guid><description>Converting BGAnimation INI files into lua files. StepMania 3.9 &amp;amp; ITG are capable of using BGAnimation.ini files to define actors in place of xml files.
In StepMania 5, these have to be converted into .lua files instead.

StepMania 3.95 &amp;amp; ITG use xml files for both themeing and effect scripting. It also allows embedding lua functions to perform more complex effects &amp;amp; scripting.
In StepMania 5, these have to be converted into .lua files instead.
The &amp;rsquo;easy way&amp;rsquo; of converting There are two semi-automatic ways to convert xml files into lua.
StepMania 5&amp;rsquo;s built-in XML to LUA converter Converts positions to be based off of SCREEN_CENTER_X (which can result in some lost position information.</description></item></channel></rss>
