The game itself would also handle approach rates for modifiers used on a Player.
With Def.NoteField, this is now done manually, since there is no &amp;ldquo;Player&amp;rdquo; to handle everything.
Applying modifiers Applying modifiers is instant, unlike the approach rate behavior usually seen.
This can be done through multiple ways:
1. Using the ModsFromString function in the NoteField.</description></item><item><title>Hidden Regions &amp; NoteType Multipliers</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/actortypes/notefield/NoteField-HiddenRegions+NoteTypeMult/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/actortypes/notefield/NoteField-HiddenRegions+NoteTypeMult/</guid><description>Hidden Regions &amp;amp; NoteType Mult are two sets of functions that allow for manipulating notes.
Hidden Regions Hidden Regions specify parts of the chart to not draw. If a hold head is in the segment, the entire hold will not draw.
Can be cleared with clear_hidden_regions or ClearHiddenRegions and also takes an optional parameter for column.
Input format The input is a table of tables. Each inner table follows the same format.</description></item><item><title>How a Player Manipulates its' NoteField</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/actortypes/notefield/NoteField-PlayerManipulation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/actortypes/notefield/NoteField-PlayerManipulation/</guid><description>Some modifiers require the Player to perform some adjustments to the NoteField. This page documents what gets affected and how.
Note that this is useful knowledge if trying to replicate some modifiers on a Def.NoteField by itself or if you need something to follow what a Player does. Any part that relies in reverse/downscroll only takes effect when the first column is more than 50% towards downscroll.
All modifiers mentioned are calculated in floating point format, so 150% would be represented as 1.</description></item><item><title>Input Manipulation</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/actortypes/notefield/NoteField-InputManipulation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/actors/actortypes/notefield/NoteField-InputManipulation/</guid><description>NoteField has multiple functions that allow for faking and manipulating input &amp;amp; judgments. Every function mentioned has a snake case alias.
DidTapNote / DidHoldNote These two functions allow for forcing a noteflash on the columns.
Both functions take three parameters: Column (First column is 1), a TapNoteScore/HoldNoteScore and whether to use the &amp;ldquo;bright&amp;rdquo; variant. (&amp;ldquo;Bright&amp;rdquo; is what&amp;rsquo;s normally used when the current combo is over a certain threshold.)
SetPressed Makes the NoteField act like the given column is pressed.</description></item></channel></rss>
