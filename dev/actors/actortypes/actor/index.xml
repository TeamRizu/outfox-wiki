You can think of an ActorFrame as a tree of objects. This is the original table. And now you&amp;rsquo;ve called GetParent on the ActorProxy.

General layout Commands General layout Def.Actor { Name= &amp;#34;Example Actor&amp;#34;, InitCommand= function(self) self:zoom(100) end, OnCommand= function(self) self:linear(2):x(30) end, } Every actor starts with a Def. prefix, followed by the actor type itself. An actor can have a name and commands. These commands could be anything, as long as it&amp;rsquo;s suffixed with a Command or MessageCommand, depending on the type of commands needed.</description></item></channel></rss>
