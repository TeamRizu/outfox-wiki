These describe what frame in a spritesheet the actor should focus on and for how long in seconds.
Sprites that use a video file do not apply for this guide, as the sprite only recognizes it as a single frame, given it&amp;rsquo;s now using FFMpeg to handle playback of said video. For this, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to obtain the Sprite&amp;rsquo;s RageTexture and use the position function, which handles its value in seconds.</description></item></channel></rss>
