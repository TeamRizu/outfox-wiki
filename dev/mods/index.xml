Some modifiers can be selected through the options menu before starting a song, but there are also simfiles with scripted modifiers that tend to have a wildly different experience than just a regular simfile. (Generally, they&amp;rsquo;re known as &amp;ldquo;modfiles&amp;rdquo;)
General notes Often, modifiers (or &amp;ldquo;mods&amp;rdquo;) have what&amp;rsquo;s called an &amp;ldquo;approach rate&amp;rdquo;, which is how fast it&amp;rsquo;ll go to reach the specified value.</description></item><item><title>Speed</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-1-Speed-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-1-Speed-Mods/</guid><description>These modifiers are used to control the scroll speed of notes in gameplay. These modifiers are not column-specific, unlike later mods described elsewhere.
Negative speed modifiers cannot be selected from the Player Options menu, nor can it be set through the lua functions PlayerOptions provides, but it can become negative through the use of mod strings (and some modfiles have taken advantage of that).
XMod Desc: The &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; in &amp;ldquo;XMod&amp;rdquo; is for multiply, with it often showing as 1x or 2.</description></item><item><title>Perspective</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-2-Perspective-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-2-Perspective-Mods/</guid><description>Perspective modifiers tilt and skew the notefield itself to allow for a feeling of depth. Scripted modfiles can use these to do effects like rocking the notefield back and forth among other effects (And is definitely noticable with 3D noteskins).
Unlike most modifiers available through PlayerOptions, these functions only return values in terms of tilt and skew and don&amp;rsquo;t return the current/previous approach rate. Perspecitve modifiers aren&amp;rsquo;t column-specific either.
Hallway Desc: The notefield is tilted away from the player, so that notes start far away and come closer.</description></item><item><title>Column movement</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-3-Column-Movement-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-3-Column-Movement-Mods/</guid><description>Column movement modifiers allow one to move the columns in any direction. Usually, these are used to create &amp;ldquo;column swaps&amp;rdquo;, which alter the visual order of the columns in gameplay.
Flip Desc: Flip alters the column order to make it appear backwards. For Example, if the column order is usually left down up right, the order becomes right up down left.
Negative values have been used to space out the columns, so values from -200% to 100% could be possible.</description></item><item><title>Scroll</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-4-Scroll-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-4-Scroll-Mods/</guid><description>Scroll modifiers affect the general scroll of the notefield. This is often used to change from upscroll to downscroll among other effects.
Reverse Desc: Reverse flips the scroll of the whole notefield from upscroll to downscroll. There is also a column-specific version that adds onto the value of normal Reverse.
Commonly, 50% or 100% is used on its' own.
Quirks: When going over 100%, the effect goes backwards, with 200% being normal upscroll again.</description></item><item><title>Rotation</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-5-Rotation-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-5-Rotation-Mods/</guid><description>Rotation modifiers rotate the notes on the x, y or z axis, and can also rotate the receptors in some cases.
Some noteskins may affect how the effect looks due to how rotation and zoom interact in the notefield.
OutFox and Open/NotITG act the same way, while earlier versions of SM5 may act differently.
Dizzy Desc: Notes spin as they reach the receptor, with more rotationz added the farther away from the receptor a note is.</description></item><item><title>Zoom</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-6-Zoom-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-6-Zoom-Mods/</guid><description>Zoom modifiers affect the size of the notefield or notes &amp;amp; receptors. Zoom works a bit differently in SM5 in that it also affects the z axis unlike in ITG/SM3.95, which only affect x &amp;amp; y.
Extra scaling may be required if recreating effects between ITG and SM5.
Mods that work on the note and column-level may make holds look a bit weird due to how hold scaling works.
Mini Desc: Mini scales down the entire notefield, while maintaining the receptor position.</description></item><item><title>Acceleration</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-7-Acceleration-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-7-Acceleration-Mods/</guid><description>Acceleration modifiers mess with the vertical acceleration of the note. It lets people have notes speed up, slow down, or do a 180 among other things.
Boomerang Desc: Notes start flying out from the top of the screen, do a 180 at around the bottom of the screen, and go back towards the receptors.
The modifier has a simple on/off nature, so any nonzero magnitude will work. (Unless the VariableBoomerang sub modifier is in play)</description></item><item><title>Visibility</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-8-Visibility-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-8-Visibility-Mods/</guid><description>Visibility Modifiers Visibility modifiers hide various parts of the gameplay screen, such as the background, notes, receptors and other things.
Cover Desc: Cover hides the song background. The range between fully lit and fully hidden scales based on the current value of the BGBrightness preference.
Use negative amounts to bring back the background if BGBrightness is less than 1. A lot of modfiles use large amounts of negative cover to deal with any positive value BGBrightness could have.</description></item><item><title>Path modifiers</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-9-Path-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-9-Path-Mods/</guid><description>Path modifiers affect the path a note takes to the receptor, often curving it in some way or creating a type of wave in the movement.
Drunk Desc: Drunk makes the notes and receptors move left and right in a constantly shifting sinusoidal wave. There are extra variants for the Y and Z axis, as well as tangent variants.
Common values can be practically any value, due to its' wide use in modfiles.</description></item><item><title>Color modifiers</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-10-Color+Gradient-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-10-Color+Gradient-Mods/</guid><description>Color modifiers affect the color of notes in some way. A lot of these follow similar behaviors to the Visibility modifiers, alongside with some extra functionalities.
&amp;lt;color&amp;gt; can be 'ColorType_Red', 'ColorType_Blue' or 'ColorType_Green', and is how one chooses the color channel to affect.
These modifiers generally share usable values between 0 to 100%.
StealthColor Desc: Bring a color channel of the notes down to zero (This does not affect the actual glow color).</description></item><item><title>ModSplines</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-11-ModSplines/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-11-ModSplines/</guid><description>ModSplines is a system that allows for arbitrary note pathing through modifiers. This system is based off the spline system used in NotITG, which means it is usable alongside the pre-existing SM5 spline system and other modifiers, too.
Points are positioned like they are for Gradient modifiers, meaning in multiples of ARROW_SIZE away from the receptor.
In SM5, this is only accessible through the PlayerOptions functions, while NotITG has functions available in Player and also has modstring versions available (Though, it&amp;rsquo;s recommended to use the lua functions instead.</description></item><item><title>Chart modifiers</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-12-Chart-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-12-Chart-Mods/</guid><description>Chart Modifiers Chart modifiers affect the chart itself, meaning what has to be stepped changes. These cannot be called during gameplay, but can be called through attacks &amp;amp; course files. All of these are boolean modifiers. At the moment, some of these aren&amp;rsquo;t properly set up for any game other than dance.
&amp;ldquo;Transform&amp;rdquo; Modifiers Transform modifiers add or remove or alter notes from the chart, affecting how the chart has to be played.</description></item><item><title>Miscellaneous modifiers</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-13-Miscellaneous-Mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mods/Mods-13-Miscellaneous-Mods/</guid><description>Miscellaneous Modifiers These modifiers don&amp;rsquo;t really fit into any of the above categories, so they&amp;rsquo;re here instead.
&amp;ldquo;clearall&amp;rdquo; Desc: Tells PlayerOptions to do a reset. Often used in modfiles to mimic crs-style resetting. Only available in modstring form right now.
Quirks: N/A
Modstring format: clearall
HoldGrainMult Desc: Adds a multiplier to the &amp;lsquo;step size&amp;rsquo; of holds, allowing one to control how &amp;lsquo;granular&amp;rsquo; a hold is.</description></item></channel></rss>
