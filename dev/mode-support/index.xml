This has been supported as early as StepMania 3.9, so everything listed here is what OutFox supports. At this point, most everyone has moved away from the KSF format in favor of SM or SSC. Like SM and SSC, sections follow this format: #SECTION:DATA;, which means #, : and ; shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used in the data segment.</description></item><item><title>SM</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mode-support/sm-support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mode-support/sm-support/</guid><description>Project OutFox contains a parser for the SM chart format, which has existed as early as StepMania 3.9, and is what most StepMania-based engines support as a base format &amp;amp; simfile cache format. With SM5, this has been succeeded by the SSC format, but for completeness, the following page contains details about what the SM format supports and used to support.
Every section follows this format: #SECTION:DATA;, which means #, ; and : shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used in the data section.</description></item><item><title>TJA Compatibility</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mode-support/tja-support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mode-support/tja-support/</guid><description>Project OutFox is working on support on the parser for the TJA (Taikojiro) chart format, which is the standard format used in conjunction with the taiko game types. The following page contains details on the Taiko parsing options that Project OutFox currently supports. This is a living document - it will be incomplete as Squirrel finds time to update and confirm/clarify items that are missing or unknown.
