The following page contains details on the BMS/PMS channels that Project OutFox currently supports. This is a living document, and will be updated as progress is made to expand the work to support as much of these as possible.
Introduction The BMS file standard was devised by Urao Yane in 1998.</description></item><item><title>DTX &amp; GDA/G2D Support</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mode-support/dtx-gda-support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mode-support/dtx-gda-support/</guid><description>Preview shot of this mode from Alpha 4.9.8 with fallback theme Project OutFox contains parsers for the DTX and GDA/G2D chart formats, which are the standard formats used in conjunction with the gddm and gdgf game types. The following table contains details on the DTX/GDA/G2D channels that Project OutFox currently supports.
We have recently added parsing support for the guitar/bass side of this chart format, and we will also look at creating a new easier to use format for gdgf in the future which supports 3/5 and 6 fret which has been requested by our community.</description></item><item><title>KSF</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mode-support/ksf-support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mode-support/ksf-support/</guid><description>Project OutFox contains a parser for the KSF chart format, which is used for Kick It Up and &amp;lsquo;Pump it Up&amp;rsquo;-style charts. This has been supported as early as StepMania 3.9, so everything listed here is what OutFox supports. At this point, most everyone has moved away from the KSF format in favor of SM or SSC. Like SM and SSC, sections follow this format: #SECTION:DATA;, which means #, : and ; shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used in the data segment.</description></item><item><title>OTO Compatibility</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mode-support/oto-support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mode-support/oto-support/</guid><description>Project OutFox is working on a new OTO notesloader that supports the .osu (Osu) chart format, which is the standard format used in conjunction with the kb and taiko game types. The following page contains details on the .osu parsing options that Project OutFox currently supports. This is a living document - it will be updated as time allows and we add the support or features within.
This documentation exists as a mental &amp;rsquo;layout&amp;rsquo; for me to learn about the format and how best to parse it for the way OutFox needs.</description></item><item><title>SM</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mode-support/sm-support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mode-support/sm-support/</guid><description>Project OutFox contains a parser for the SM chart format, which has existed as early as StepMania 3.9, and is what most StepMania-based engines support as a base format &amp;amp; simfile cache format. With SM5, this has been succeeded by the SSC format, but for completeness, the following page contains details about what the SM format supports and used to support.
Every section follows this format: #SECTION:DATA;, which means #, ; and : shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used in the data section.</description></item><item><title>TJA Compatibility</title><link>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mode-support/tja-support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outfox.wiki/dev/mode-support/tja-support/</guid><description>Project OutFox is working on support on the parser for the TJA (Taikojiro) chart format, which is the standard format used in conjunction with the taiko game types. The following page contains details on the Taiko parsing options that Project OutFox currently supports. This is a living document - it will be incomplete as Squirrel finds time to update and confirm/clarify items that are missing or unknown.
TJA Notedata support as of Alpha 4.</description></item></channel></rss>
